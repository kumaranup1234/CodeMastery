    "title": "What is React?",
    "answer": "React (aka React.js or ReactJS) is an **open-source front-end JavaScript library** for building user interfaces based on components. It's used for handling the view layer in web and mobile applications, and allows developers to create reusable UI components and manage the state of those components efficiently.\n\n    React was created by [Jordan Walke](https://github.com/jordwalke), a software engineer at Facebook (now Meta). It was first deployed on Facebook's News Feed in 2011 and on Instagram in 2012. The library was open-sourced in May 2013 and has since become one of the most popular JavaScript libraries for building modern user interfaces.\n\n    \n\n   2.  ### What is the history behind React evolution?\n       The history of ReactJS started in 2010 with the creation of **XHP**. XHP is a PHP extension which improved the syntax of the language such that XML document fragments become valid PHP expressions and the primary purpose was used to create custom and reusable HTML elements.\n\n       The main principle of this extension was to make front-end code easier to understand and to help avoid cross-site scripting attacks. The project was successful to prevent the malicious content submitted by the scrubbing user.\n\n       But there was a different problem with XHP in which dynamic web applications require many roundtrips to the server, and XHP did not solve this problem. Also, the whole UI was re-rendered for small change in the application. Later, the initial prototype of React is created with the name **FaxJ** by Jordan inspired from XHP. Finally after sometime React has been introduced as a new library into JavaScript world.\n\n       <details>\n           <summary><b>See deep-dive answer</b></summary>\n           The evolution of React has a fascinating history that spans over a decade:\n    \n       **2010-2011: The Origins**\n       - The journey began with **XHP**, a PHP extension created at Facebook that allowed HTML components to be used in PHP code\n       - XHP improved front-end code readability and helped prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks\n       - However, XHP had limitations with dynamic web applications, requiring frequent server roundtrips and complete UI re-renders for small changes\n\n       **2011-2012: Early Development**\n       - Jordan Walke created the first prototype called **FaxJS** (later renamed to React), inspired by XHP's component model\n       - The key innovation was bringing XHP's component model to JavaScript with performance improvements\n       - React introduced the Virtual DOM concept to solve the performance issues of full page re-renders\n       - First deployed internally on Facebook's News Feed in 2011 and Instagram in 2012\n\n       **2013: Public Release**\n       - React was officially open-sourced at JSConf US in May 2013\n       - Initial public reception was mixed, with some developers skeptical about the JSX syntax and the approach of mixing markup with JavaScript\n\n       **2014-2015: Growing Adoption**\n       - React Native was announced in 2015, extending React's paradigm to mobile app development\n       - The ecosystem began to grow with tools like Redux for state management\n       - Companies beyond Facebook began adopting React for production applications\n\n       **2016-2018: Maturation**\n       - React 16 (\"Fiber\") was released in 2017 with a complete rewrite of the core architecture\n       - Introduction of new features like Error Boundaries, Portals, and improved server-side rendering\n       - React 16.3 introduced the Context API for easier state management\n\n       **2019-Present: Modern React**\n       - React Hooks were introduced in React 16.8 (February 2019), revolutionizing state management in functional components\n       - React 17 (October 2020) focused on making React upgrades easier\n       - React 18 (March 2022) introduced concurrent rendering and automatic batching\n       - React continues to evolve with Server Components, the new React compiler (React Forget), and other performance improvements\n       </details>\n\n       **Note:** JSX, React's syntax extension, was indeed inspired by XHP's approach of embedding XML-like syntax in code."

    "title": "What are the major features of React?",
    "answer": "React offers a powerful set of features that have made it one of the most popular JavaScript libraries for building user interfaces:\n\n    **Core Features:**\n\n    - **Component-Based Architecture**: React applications are built using components - independent, reusable pieces of code that return HTML via a render function. This modular approach enables better code organization, reusability, and maintenance.\n\n    - **Virtual DOM**: React creates an in-memory data structure cache, computes the resulting differences, and efficiently updates only the changed parts in the browser DOM. This approach significantly improves performance compared to direct DOM manipulation.\n\n    - **JSX (JavaScript XML)**: A syntax extension that allows writing HTML-like code in JavaScript. JSX makes the code more readable and expressive while providing the full power of JavaScript.\n\n    - **Unidirectional Data Flow**: React follows a one-way data binding model where data flows from parent to child components. This makes the code more predictable and easier to debug.\n\n    - **Declarative UI**: React allows you to describe what your UI should look like for a given state, and it handles the DOM updates when the underlying data changes.\n\n    **Advanced Features:**\n\n    - **React Hooks**: Introduced in React 16.8, hooks allow using state and other React features in functional components without writing classes.\n\n    - **Context API**: Provides a way to share values between components without explicitly passing props through every level of the component tree.\n\n    - **Error Boundaries**: Components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree and display fallback UI instead of crashing.\n\n    - **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Enables rendering React components on the server before sending HTML to the client, improving performance and SEO.\n\n    - **Concurrent Mode**: A set of new features (in development) that help React apps stay responsive and gracefully adjust to the user's device capabilities and network speed.\n\n    - **React Server Components**: A new feature that allows components to be rendered entirely on the server, reducing bundle size and improving performance.\n\n    - **Suspense**: A feature that lets your components \"wait\" for something before rendering, supporting code-splitting and data fetching with cleaner code.\n\n    These features collectively make React powerful for building everything from small widgets to complex, large-scale web applications."

    "answer": "_JSX_ stands for _JavaScript XML_ and it is an XML-like syntax extension to ECMAScript. Basically it just provides the syntactic sugar for the `React.createElement(type, props, ...children)` function, giving us expressiveness of JavaScript along with HTML like template syntax.\n\n    In the example below, the text inside `<h1>` tag is returned as JavaScript function to the render function.\n\n    ```jsx harmony\n    export default function App() {\n      return <h1 className=\"greeting\">{\"Hello, this is a JSX Code!\"}</h1>;\n    }\n    ```javascript\n\n    If you don't use JSX syntax then the respective JavaScript code should be written as below,\n\n    ```javascript\n    import { createElement } from \"react\";\n\n    export default function App() {\n      return createElement(\n        \"h1\",\n        { className: \"greeting\" },\n        \"Hello, this is a JSX Code!\"\n      );\n    }\n    ```javascript\n\n     <details><summary><b>See Class</b></summary>\n     <p>\n\n    ```jsx harmony\n    class App extends React.Component {\n      render() {\n        return <h1 className=\"greeting\">{\"Hello, this is a JSX Code!\"}</h1>;\n      }\n    }\n    ```javascript\n\n     </p>\n     </details>\n\n    **Note:** JSX is stricter than HTML"

    "title": "What is the difference between an Element and a Component?",
    "answer": "**Element:**\n      - A React **Element** is a plain JavaScript object that describes what you want to see on the UI. It represents a DOM node or a component at a specific point in time. \n      - Elements are immutable: once created, you cannot change their properties. Instead, you create new elements to reflect updates.\n      - Elements can be nested within other elements through their `props`.\n      - Creating an element is a fast, lightweight operation—it does **not** create any actual DOM nodes or render anything to the screen directly.\n\n        **Example (without JSX):**\n        ```js\n        const element = React.createElement(\"button\", { id: \"login-btn\" }, \"Login\");\n        ```javascript\n\n        **Equivalent JSX syntax:**\n        ```jsx\n        <button id=\"login-btn\">Login</button>\n        ```javascript\n\n        **The object returned by `React.createElement`:**\n        ```js\n        {\n          type: 'button',\n          props: {\n            id: 'login-btn',\n            children: 'Login'\n          }\n        }\n        ```javascript\n        Elements are then passed to the React DOM renderer (e.g., `ReactDOM.render()`), which translates them to actual DOM nodes.\n\n        ---\n\n      **Component:**\n      - A **Component** is a function or class that returns an element (or a tree of elements) to describe part of the UI. Components can accept inputs (called **props**) and manage their own state (in case of class or function components with hooks).\n      - Components allow you to split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, each isolated and composable.\n      - You can define a component using a function or a class:\n\n        **Example (Function Component with JSX):**\n        ```jsx\n        const Button = ({ handleLogin }) => (\n          <button id=\"login-btn\" onClick={handleLogin}>\n            Login\n          </button>\n        );\n        ```javascript\n\n        When JSX is compiled, it's transformed into a tree of `React.createElement` calls:\n\n        ```js\n        const Button = ({ handleLogin }) =>\n          React.createElement(\n            \"button\",\n            { id: \"login-btn\", onClick: handleLogin },\n            \"Login\"\n          );\n        ```javascript\n\n        ---\n\n      **In summary:**\n      - **Elements** are the smallest building blocks in React—objects that describe what you want to see.\n      - **Components** are functions or classes that return elements and encapsulate logic, structure, and behavior for parts of your UI.\n\n       > Think of **elements** as the instructions for creating UI, and **components** as reusable blueprints that combine logic and structure to generate those instructions."

    "title": "How to create components in React?",
    "answer": "Components are the building blocks of creating User Interfaces(UI) in React. There are two possible ways to create a component.\n\n    1. **Function Components:** This is the simplest way to create a component. Those are pure JavaScript functions that accept props object as the one and only one parameter and return React elements to render the output:\n\n       ```jsx harmony\n       function Greeting({ message }) {\n         return <h1>{`Hello, ${message}`}</h1>;\n       }\n       ```javascript\n\n    2. **Class Components:** You can also use ES6 class to define a component. The above function component can be written as a class component:\n\n       ```jsx harmony\n       class Greeting extends React.Component {\n         render() {\n           return <h1>{`Hello, ${this.props.message}`}</h1>;\n         }\n       }\n       ```"

    "title": "When to use a Class Component over a Function Component?",
    "answer": "After the addition of Hooks(i.e. React 16.8 onwards) it is always recommended to use Function components over Class components in React. Because you could use state, lifecycle methods and other features that were only available in class component present in function component too.\n\n    But even there are two reasons to use Class components over Function components.\n\n    1. If you need a React functionality whose Function component equivalent is not present yet, like Error Boundaries.\n    2. In older versions, If the component needs _state or lifecycle methods_ then you need to use class component.\n\n    So the summary to this question is as follows:\n\n    **Use Function Components:**\n\n    - If you don't need state or lifecycle methods, and your component is purely presentational.\n    - For simplicity, readability, and modern code practices, especially with the use of React Hooks for state and side effects.\n\n    **Use Class Components:**\n\n    - If you need to manage state or use lifecycle methods.\n    - In scenarios where backward compatibility or integration with older code is necessary.\n\n    **Note:** You can also use reusable [react error boundary](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-error-boundary) third-party component without writing any class. i.e, No need to use class components for Error boundaries.\n\n    The usage of Error boundaries from the above library is quite straight forward.\n\n    > **_Note when using react-error-boundary:_** ErrorBoundary is a client component. You can only pass props to it that are serializable or use it in files that have a `\"use client\";` directive.\n\n    ```jsx\n    \"use client\";\n\n    import { ErrorBoundary } from \"react-error-boundary\";\n\n    <ErrorBoundary fallback={<div>Something went wrong</div>}>\n      <ExampleApplication />\n    </ErrorBoundary>;\n    ```"

    "title": "What are Pure Components?",
    "answer": "Pure components are the components which render the same output for the same state and props. In function components, you can achieve these pure components through memoized `React.memo()` API wrapping around the component. This API prevents unnecessary re-renders by comparing the previous props and new props using shallow comparison. So it will be helpful for performance optimizations.\n\n    But at the same time, it won't compare the previous state with the current state because function component itself prevents the unnecessary rendering by default when you set the same state again.\n\n    The syntactic representation of memoized components looks like below,\n\n    ```jsx\n    const MemoizedComponent = memo(SomeComponent, arePropsEqual?);\n    ```javascript\n\n    Below is the example of how child component(i.e., EmployeeProfile) prevents re-renders for the same props passed by parent component(i.e.,EmployeeRegForm).\n\n    ```jsx\n    import { memo, useState } from \"react\";\n\n    const EmployeeProfile = memo(function EmployeeProfile({ name, email }) {\n      return (\n        <>\n          <p>Name:{name}</p>\n          <p>Email: {email}</p>\n        </>\n      );\n    });\n    export default function EmployeeRegForm() {\n      const [name, setName] = useState(\"\");\n      const [email, setEmail] = useState(\"\");\n      return (\n        <>\n          <label>\n            Name:{\" \"}\n            <input value={name} onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)} />\n          </label>\n          <label>\n            Email:{\" \"}\n            <input value={email} onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)} />\n          </label>\n          <hr />\n          <EmployeeProfile name={name} />\n        </>\n      );\n    }\n    ```javascript\n\n    In the above code, the email prop has not been passed to child component. So there won't be any re-renders for email prop change.\n\n    In class components, the components extending _`React.PureComponent`_ instead of _`React.Component`_ become the pure components. When props or state changes, _PureComponent_ will do a shallow comparison on both props and state by invoking `shouldComponentUpdate()` lifecycle method.\n\n    **Note:** `React.memo()` is a higher-order component."

    "title": "What is state in React?",
    "answer": "_State_ of a component is an object that holds some information that may change over the lifetime of the component. The important point is whenever the state object changes, the component re-renders. It is always recommended to make our state as simple as possible and minimize the number of stateful components.\n\n    ![state](images/state.jpg)\n\n    Let's take an example of **User** component with `message` state. Here, **useState** hook has been used to add state to the User component and it returns an array with current state and function to update it.\n\n    ```jsx harmony\n    import { useState } from \"react\";\n\n    function User() {\n      const [message, setMessage] = useState(\"Welcome to React world\");\n\n      return (\n        <div>\n          <h1>{message}</h1>\n        </div>\n      );\n    }\n    ```javascript\n\n    Whenever React calls your component or access `useState` hook, it gives you a snapshot of the state for that particular render.\n\n    <details><summary><b>See Class</b></summary>\n    <p>\n\n    ```jsx harmony\n    import React from \"react\";\n    class User extends React.Component {\n      constructor(props) {\n        super(props);\n\n        this.state = {\n          message: \"Welcome to React world\",\n        };\n      }\n\n      render() {\n        return (\n          <div>\n            <h1>{this.state.message}</h1>\n          </div>\n        );\n      }\n    }\n    ```javascript\n\n    </p>\n    </details>\n\n    State is similar to props, but it is private and fully controlled by the component ,i.e., it is not accessible to any other component till the owner component decides to pass it."

    "title": "What are props in React?",
    "answer": "_Props_ are inputs to components. They are single values or objects containing a set of values that are passed to components on creation similar to HTML-tag attributes. Here, the data is passed down from a parent component to a child component.\n\n    The primary purpose of props in React is to provide following component functionality:\n\n    1. Pass custom data to your component.\n    2. Trigger state changes.\n    3. Use via `this.props.reactProp` inside component's `render()` method.\n\n    For example, let us create an element with `reactProp` property:\n\n    ```jsx harmony\n    <Element reactProp={\"1\"} />\n    ```javascript\n\n    This `reactProp` (or whatever you came up with) attribute name then becomes a property attached to React's native props object which originally already exists on all components created using React library.\n\n    ```jsx harmony\n    props.reactProp;\n    ```javascript\n\n    For example, the usage of props in function component looks like below:\n\n    ```jsx\n    import React from \"react\";\n    import ReactDOM from \"react-dom\";\n\n    const ChildComponent = (props) => {\n      return (\n        <div>\n          <p>{props.name}</p>\n          <p>{props.age}</p>\n          <p>{props.gender}</p>\n        </div>\n      );\n    };\n\n    const ParentComponent = () => {\n      return (\n        <div>\n          <ChildComponent name=\"John\" age=\"30\" gender=\"male\" />\n          <ChildComponent name=\"Mary\" age=\"25\" geneder=\"female\" />\n        </div>\n      );\n    };\n    ```javascript\n\nThe properties from props object can be accessed directly using destructing feature from ES6 (ECMAScript 2015). It is also possible to fallback to default value when the prop value is not specified. The above child component can be simplified like below.\n\n```jsx harmony\nconst ChildComponent = ({ name, age, gender = \"male\" }) => {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>{name}</p>\n      <p>{age}</p>\n      <p>{gender}</p>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n```javascript\n\n**Note:** The default value won't be used if you pass `null` or `0` value. i.e, default value is only used if the prop value is missed or `undefined` value has been passed.\n\n  <details><summary><b>See Class</b></summary>\n     The Props accessed in Class Based Component as below\n\n```jsx\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport ReactDOM from \"react-dom\";\n\nclass ChildComponent extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <p>{this.props.name}</p>\n        <p>{this.props.age}</p>\n        <p>{this.props.gender}</p>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nclass ParentComponent extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <ChildComponent name=\"John\" age=\"30\" gender=\"male\" />\n        <ChildComponent name=\"Mary\" age=\"25\" gender=\"female\" />\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n```javascript\n\n  </details>"

    "title": "What is the difference between HTML and React event handling?",
    "answer": "Below are some of the main differences between HTML and React event handling,\n\n    1. In HTML, the event name usually represents in _lowercase_ as a convention:\n\n       ```html\n       <button onclick=\"activateLasers()\"></button>\n       ```javascript\n\n       Whereas in React it follows _camelCase_ convention:\n\n       ```jsx harmony\n       <button onClick={activateLasers}>\n       ```javascript\n\n    2. In HTML, you can return `false` to prevent default behavior:\n\n       ```html\n       <a\n         href=\"#\"\n         onclick='console.log(\"The link was clicked.\"); return false;'\n       />\n       ```javascript\n\n       Whereas in React you must call `preventDefault()` explicitly:\n\n       ```javascript\n       function handleClick(event) {\n         event.preventDefault();\n         console.log(\"The link was clicked.\");\n       }\n       ```javascript\n\n    3. In HTML, you need to invoke the function by appending `()`\n       Whereas in react you should not append `()` with the function name. (refer \"activateLasers\" function in the first point for example)"

    "title": "What are synthetic events in React?",
    "answer": "`SyntheticEvent` is a cross-browser wrapper around the browser's native event. Its API is same as the browser's native event, including `stopPropagation()` and `preventDefault()`, except the events work identically across all browsers. The native events can be accessed directly from synthetic events using `nativeEvent` attribute.\n\n    Let's take an example of `BookStore` title search component with the ability to get all native event properties\n\n    ```js\n    function BookStore() {\n      function handleTitleChange(e) {\n        console.log(\"The new title is:\", e.target.value);\n        console.log('Synthetic event:', e); // React SyntheticEvent\n        console.log('Native event:', e.nativeEvent); // Browser native event\n        e.stopPropagation();\n        e.preventDefault();\n      }\n\n      return <input name=\"title\" onChange={handleTitleChange} />;\n    }\n    ```javascript\n    \n    List of common synthetic events are:\n\n    *   `onClick`\n    *   `onChange`\n    *   `onSubmit`\n    *   `onKeyDown`, `onKeyUp`\n    *   `onFocus`, `onBlur`\n    *   `onMouseEnter`, `onMouseLeave`\n    *   `onTouchStart`, `onTouchEnd`"

    "title": "What are inline conditional expressions?",
    "answer": "You can use either _if statements_ or _ternary expressions_ which are available in JS(and JSX in React) to conditionally execute or render expressions. Apart from these approaches, you can also embed any expressions in JSX by wrapping them in curly braces and then followed by JS logical operator `&&`. It is helpful to render elements conditionally within a single line and commonly used for concise logic, especially in JSX rendering.\n\n    ```jsx harmony\n    <h1>Hello!</h1>;\n    {\n      messages.length > 0 && !isLogin ? (\n        <h2>You have {messages.length} unread messages.</h2>\n      ) : (\n        <h2>You don't have unread messages.</h2>\n      );\n    }\n    ```"

    "title": "What is \"key\" prop and what is the benefit of using it in arrays of elements?",
    "answer": "A `key` is a special attribute you **should** include when mapping over arrays to render data. _Key_ prop helps React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed.\n\n    Keys should be unique among its siblings. Most often we use ID from our data as _key_:\n\n    ```jsx harmony\n    const todoItems = todos.map((todo) => <li key={todo.id}>{todo.text}</li>);\n    ```javascript\n\n    When you don't have stable IDs for rendered items, you may use the item _index_ as a _key_ as a last resort:\n\n    ```jsx harmony\n    const todoItems = todos.map((todo, index) => (\n      <li key={index}>{todo.text}</li>\n    ));\n    ```javascript\n    **Benefits of key:**\n      *   Enables React to **efficiently update and re-render** components.\n      *   Prevents unnecessary re-renders by **reusing** components when possible.\n      *   Helps **maintain internal state** of list items correctly.\n\n    **Note:**\n\n    1. Using _indexes_ for _keys_ is **not recommended** if the order of items may change. This can negatively impact performance and may cause issues with component state.\n    2. If you extract list item as separate component then apply _keys_ on list component instead of `li` tag.\n    3. There will be a warning message in the console if the `key` prop is not present on list items.\n    4. The key attribute accepts either string or number and internally convert it as string type.\n    5. Don't generate the key on the fly something like `key={Math.random()}`. Because the keys will never match up between re-renders and DOM created everytime."

    "answer": "The _Virtual DOM_ (VDOM) is a lightweight, in-memory representation of _Real DOM_ used by libraries like React to optimize UI rendering. The representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the \"real\" DOM. It's a step that happens between the render function being called and the displaying of elements on the screen.

    "title": "How Virtual DOM works?",
    "answer": "The _Virtual DOM_ works in five simple steps.\n\n    **1. Initial Render**  \n        When a UI component renders for the first time, it returns JSX. React uses this structure to create a Virtual DOM tree, which is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM. This Virtual DOM is then used to build and render the Real DOM in the browser.\n\n    **2. State or Props Change**  \n        When the component's state or props change, React creates a new Virtual DOM reflecting the updated UI. However, it doesn't immediately update the Real DOM; instead, it works in memory to prepare for an efficient update.\n               \n      ![vdom](images/vdom1.png)\n\n    **3. Diffing Algorithm**  \n        React then compares the new Virtual DOM with the previous one using a process called diffing. It determines what has changed between the two versions and identifies the minimal set of updates needed.\n       \n       ![vdom2](images/vdom2.png)  \n\n    **4. Reconciliation**  \n        Based on the diffing results, React decides which parts of the Real DOM should be updated. It avoids re-rendering the entire DOM and instead updates only the elements that actually changed.\n        \n       ![vdom3](images/vdom3.png)\n\n    **5. Efficient DOM Updates**  \n        This entire process—working with the Virtual DOM, diffing, and selective updating—makes the UI rendering much faster and more efficient than manipulating the Real DOM directly."

    "title": "What are controlled components?",
    "answer": "A **controlled component** is a React component that **fully manages the form element's state**(e.g, elements like `<input>`, `<textarea>`, or `<select>`))  using React's internal state mechanism. i.e, The component does not manage its own internal state — instead, React acts as the single source of truth for form data.\n\n    The controlled components will be implemented using the below steps,\n\n    1. Initialize the state using `useState` hooks in function components or inside constructor for class components.\n    2. Set the value of the form element to the respective state variable.\n    3. Create an event handler(`onChange`) to handle the user input changes through `useState`'s updater function or `setState` from class component.\n    4. Attach the above event handler to form element's change or click events\n\n    **Note:** React re-renders the component every time the input value changes.\n\n   For example, the name input field updates the username using `handleChange` event handler as below,\n\n   ```javascript\n   import React, { useState } from \"react\";\n\n   function UserProfile() {\n     const [username, setUsername] = useState(\"\");\n\n     const handleChange = (e) => {\n       setUsername(e.target.value);\n     };\n\n     return (\n       <form>\n         <label>\n           Name:\n           <input type=\"text\" value={username} onChange={handleChange} />\n         </label>\n       </form>\n     );\n   }\n   ```javascript\n   In these components, DOM does not hold the actual data instead React does.\n   \n   **Benefits:**\n\n   *   Easy to implement **validation**, **conditional formatting**, or **live feedback**.\n   *   Full control over form data.\n   *   Easier to test and debug because the data is centralized in the component’s state."

    "title": "What are uncontrolled components?",
    "answer": "The **Uncontrolled components** are form elements (like `<input>`, `<textarea>`, or `<select>`) that **manage their own state internally** via the **DOM**, rather than through React state.\n    You can query the DOM using a `ref` to find its current value when you need it. This is a bit more like traditional HTML.\n\n    The uncontrolled components will be implemented using the below steps,\n\n    1. Create a ref using `useRef` react hook in function component or `React.createRef()` in class based component.\n    2. Attach this `ref` to the form element.\n    3. The form element value can be accessed directly through `ref` in event handlers or `componentDidMount` for class components\n\n    In the below UserProfile component, the `username` input is accessed using ref.\n\n    ```jsx harmony\n    import React, { useRef } from \"react\";\n\n    function UserProfile() {\n      const usernameRef = useRef(null);\n\n      const handleSubmit = (event) => {\n        event.preventDefault();\n        console.log(\"The submitted username is: \" + usernameRef.current.value);\n      };\n\n      return (\n        <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>\n          <label>\n            Username:\n            <input type=\"text\" ref={usernameRef} />\n          </label>\n          <button type=\"submit\">Submit</button>\n        </form>\n      );\n    }\n    ```javascript\n    **Note:** Here, DOM is in charge of the value. React only accesses the value when needed (via `ref`).\n\n    **Benefits:**\n     *   **Less boilerplate** — no need for `useState` and `onChange`.\n     *   Useful for **quick form setups** or when integrating with **non-React code**.\n     *   Slightly better **performance** in very large forms (fewer re-renders).\n\n    In most cases, it's recommend to use controlled components to implement forms. In a controlled component, form data is handled by a React component. The alternative is uncontrolled components, where form data is handled by the DOM itself.\n\n    <details><summary><b>See Class</b></summary>\n    <p>\n\n    ```jsx harmony\n    class UserProfile extends React.Component {\n      constructor(props) {\n        super(props);\n        this.handleSubmit = this.handleSubmit.bind(this);\n        this.input = React.createRef();\n      }\n\n      handleSubmit(event) {\n        alert(\"A name was submitted: \" + this.input.current.value);\n        event.preventDefault();\n      }\n\n      render() {\n        return (\n          <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>\n            <label>\n              {\"Name:\"}\n              <input type=\"text\" ref={this.input} />\n            </label>\n            <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\" />\n          </form>\n        );\n      }\n    }\n    ```javascript\n\n    </p>\n    </details>"

    "title": "What are Higher-Order Components?",
    "answer": "A _higher-order component_ (_HOC_) is a function that takes a component and returns a new enhanced component with additional props, behavior, or data. It’s a design pattern based on React’s compositional nature, allowing you to reuse logic across multiple components without modifying their internals.\n\n    We consider HOCs **pure components** because they don’t mutate or copy behavior from the original component—they simply **wrap it**, enhance it, and pass through the necessary props. The wrapped component remains decoupled and reusable.\n\n    ```javascript\n    const EnhancedComponent = higherOrderComponent(WrappedComponent);\n    ```javascript\n    Let's take an example of a `withAuth` higher-order component (HOC) in React. This HOC will check if a user is authenticated and either render the wrapped component if authenticated or redirect (or show a message) if not.\n\n    **withAuth HOC Example:**\n    ```jsx\n    import React from 'react';\n    import { Navigate } from 'react-router-dom'; // For redirection (assuming React Router v6)\n\n    const isAuthenticated = () => {\n      // e.g., check for a valid token in localStorage or context\n      return !!localStorage.getItem('authToken');\n    };\n\n    function withAuth(WrappedComponent) {\n      return function AuthenticatedComponent(props) {\n        if (!isAuthenticated()) {\n          // User is NOT authenticated, redirect to login page\n          return <Navigate to=\"/login\" replace />;\n        }\n\n        // User is authenticated, render the wrapped component\n        return <WrappedComponent {...props} />;\n      };\n    }\n\n    export default withAuth;\n    ```javascript\n    **Usage**\n    ```jsx\n    import React from 'react';\n    import withAuth from './withAuth';\n\n    function Dashboard() {\n      return <h1>Welcome to the Dashboard!</h1>;\n    }\n\n    // Wrap Dashboard with withAuth HOC\n    export default withAuth(Dashboard);\n    ```javascript\n\n    HOC can be used for many use cases:\n\n    1. Code reuse, logic and bootstrap abstraction (e.g., fetching data, permissions, theming).\n    2. Render hijacking (e.g., conditional rendering or layout changes).\n    3. State abstraction and manipulation(e.g., handling form logic).\n    4. Props manipulation(e.g., injecting additional props or filtering them).\n    \n    Some of the real-world examples of HOCs in react eco-system:\n    1. connect() from react-redux\n    2. withRouter() from React Router v5\n    3. withTranslation() from react-i18next\n    4. withApollo() from Apollo client\n    5. withFormik from Formik library\n    6. withTheme from styled components"

This comparison is done by `Diffing Algorithm`.\n    Now React compares the Virtual DOM with Real DOM. It finds out the changed nodes and updates only the changed nodes in Real DOM leaving the rest nodes as it is. This process is called _Reconciliation_."

    "answer": "No, currently `React.lazy` function supports default exports only. If you would like to import modules which are named exports, you can create an intermediate module that reexports it as the default. It also ensures that tree shaking keeps working and don’t pull unused components.\n    Let's take a component file which exports multiple named components,\n\n    ```javascript\n    // MoreComponents.js\n    export const SomeComponent = /* ... */;\n    export const UnusedComponent = /* ... */;\n    ```javascript\n\n    and reexport `MoreComponents.js` components in an intermediate file `IntermediateComponent.js`\n\n    ```javascript\n    // IntermediateComponent.js\n    export { SomeComponent as default } from \"./MoreComponents.js\";\n    ```javascript\n\n    Now you can import the module using lazy function as below,\n\n    ```javascript\n    import React, { lazy } from \"react\";\n    const SomeComponent = lazy(() => import(\"./IntermediateComponent.js\"));\n    ```"

    "title": "Why React uses `className` over `class` attribute?",
    "answer": "React uses **className** instead of **class** because of a JavaScript naming conflict with the class keyword.\n\n    1. `class` is a reserved keyword in JavaScript\n        In JavaScript, class is used to define ES6 classes:\n      \n        ```js\n        class Person {\n          constructor(name) {\n            this.name = name;\n          }\n        }\n        ```javascript\n        If you try to use class as a variable or property name, it will throw a syntax error. Since JSX is just JavaScript with XML-like syntax, using class directly in JSX would break the parser.\n\n    2. JSX Is JavaScript\n    \n        When you write JSX like this:\n        ```jsx\n        <div class=\"btn\">Click</div>\n        ```javascript\n        It will be compiled to:\n        ```jsx\n        React.createElement('div', { class: 'btn' }, 'Click');\n        ```javascript\n        But `class` is invalid in this object literal context (since it clashes with the JS keyword), hence React instead uses className.\n        ```jsx\n        <div className=\"btn\">Click</div>\n        ```javascript\n        which compiles to:\n        ```jsx\n        React.createElement('div', { className: 'btn' }, 'Click');\n        ```javascript\n        React then translates `className` to` class` in the final HTML DOM.\n\n    3. Aligns with DOM APIs\n        In vanilla JavaScript, you interact with element classes using:\n        ```js\n        element.className = 'my-class';\n        ```javascript\n        React follows this convention, staying consistent with the DOM API's property name rather than HTML’s attribute."

    "title": "What are fragments?",
    "answer": "It's a common pattern or practice in React for a component to return multiple elements. _Fragments_ let you group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM.\n    You need to use either `<Fragment>` or a shorter syntax having empty tag (`<></>`).\n\n    Below is the example of how to use fragment inside _Story_ component.\n\n    ```jsx harmony\n    function Story({ title, description, date }) {\n      return (\n        <Fragment>\n          <h2>{title}</h2>\n          <p>{description}</p>\n          <p>{date}</p>\n        </Fragment>\n      );\n    }\n    ```javascript\n\n    It is also possible to render list of fragments inside a loop with the mandatory **key** attribute supplied.\n\n    ```jsx harmony\n    function StoryBook() {\n      return stories.map((story) => (\n        <Fragment key={story.id}>\n          <h2>{story.title}</h2>\n          <p>{story.description}</p>\n          <p>{story.date}</p>\n        </Fragment>\n      ));\n    }\n    ```javascript\n\n    Usually, you don't need to use `<Fragment>` until there is a need of _key_ attribute. The usage of shorter syntax looks like below.\n\n    ```jsx harmony\n    function Story({ title, description, date }) {\n      return (\n        <>\n          <h2>{title}</h2>\n          <p>{description}</p>\n          <p>{date}</p>\n        </>\n      );\n    }\n    ```"

This only has a real benefit on very large and deep trees.\n    2. Some CSS mechanisms like _Flexbox_ and _CSS Grid_ have a special parent-child relationships, and adding divs in the middle makes it hard to keep the desired layout.\n    3.

    "answer": "A Portal is a React feature that enables rendering children into a DOM node that exists outside the parent component's DOM hierarchy, while still preserving the React component hierarchy. Portals help avoid CSS stacking issues—for example, elements with position: fixed may not behave as expected inside a parent with transform. Portals solve this by rendering content (like modals or tooltips) outside such constrained DOM contexts.\n\n    ```javascript\n    ReactDOM.createPortal(child, container);\n    ```javascript\n    *   `child`: Any valid React node (e.g., JSX, string, fragment).\n    *   `container`: A real DOM node (e.g., `document.getElementById('modal-root')`).\n\n    Even though the content renders elsewhere in the DOM, it still behaves like a normal child in React. It has access to context, state, and event handling.\n\n    **Example:- Modal:**\n    ```jsx\n    function Modal({ children }) {\n      return ReactDOM.createPortal(\n        <div className=\"modal\">{children}</div>,\n        document.body)\n      );\n    }\n    ```javascript\n    The above code will render the modal content into the body element in the HTML, not inside the component's usual location."

We need to use object to map prop values to components.\n\n    For example, a switching component to display different pages based on `page` prop:\n\n    ```jsx harmony\n    import HomePage from \"./HomePage\";\n    import AboutPage from \"./AboutPage\";\n    import ServicesPage from \"./ServicesPage\";\n    import ContactPage from \"./ContactPage\";\n\n    const PAGES = {\n      home: HomePage,\n      about: AboutPage,\n      services: ServicesPage,\n      contact: ContactPage,\n    };\n\n    const Page = (props) => {\n      const Handler = PAGES[props.page] || ContactPage;\n\n      return <Handler {...props} />;\n    };\n\n    // The keys of the PAGES object can be used in the prop types to catch dev-time errors.\n    Page.propTypes = {\n      page: PropTypes.oneOf(Object.keys(PAGES)).isRequired,\n    };\n    ```"

    "answer": "_Mixins_ are a way to totally separate components to have a common functionality. Mixins **should not be used** and can be replaced with _higher-order components_ or _decorators_.\n\n    One of the most commonly used mixins is `PureRenderMixin`. You might be using it in some components to prevent unnecessary re-renders when the props and state are shallowly equal to the previous props and state:\n\n    ```javascript\n    const PureRenderMixin = require(\"react-addons-pure-render-mixin\");\n\n    const Button = React.createClass({\n      mixins: [PureRenderMixin],\n      // ...\n    });\n    ```javascript\n\n     <!-- TODO: mixins are deprecated -->"

    "answer": "_Pointer Events_ provide a unified way of handling all input events. In the old days we had a mouse and respective event listeners to handle them but nowadays we have many devices which don't correlate to having a mouse, like phones with touch surface or pens. We need to remember that these events will only work in browsers that support the _Pointer Events_ specification.\n\n    The following event types are now available in _React DOM_:\n\n    1. `onPointerDown`\n    2. `onPointerMove`\n    3. `onPointerUp`\n    4. `onPointerCancel`\n    5. `onGotPointerCapture`\n    6. `onLostPointerCapture`\n    7. `onPointerEnter`\n    8. `onPointerLeave`\n    9. `onPointerOver`\n    10. `onPointerOut`"

    "title": "How to loop inside JSX?",
    "answer": "You can simply use `Array.prototype.map` with ES6 _arrow function_ syntax.\n\n    For example, the `items` array of objects is mapped into an array of components:\n\n    ```jsx harmony\n    <tbody>\n      {items.map((item) => (\n        <SomeComponent key={item.id} name={item.name} />\n      ))}\n    </tbody>\n    ```javascript\n\n    But you can't iterate using `for` loop:\n\n    ```jsx harmony\n    <tbody>\n      for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {\n        <SomeComponent key={items[i].id} name={items[i].name} />\n      }\n    </tbody>\n    ```javascript\n\n    This is because JSX tags are transpiled into _function calls_, and you can't use statements inside expressions.

As JSX offers slightly different syntax to regular HTML, issues with `alt` text and `tabindex`, for example, will not be picked up by regular plugins."

    "title": "How do you programmatically navigate using React Router v4?",
    "answer": "There are three different ways to achieve programmatic routing/navigation within components.\n\n    1.  **Using the `withRouter()` higher-order function:**\n\n        The `withRouter()` higher-order function will inject the history object as a prop of the component. This object provides `push()` and `replace()` methods to avoid the usage of context.\n\n        ```jsx harmony\n        import { withRouter } from \"react-router-dom\"; // this also works with 'react-router-native'\n\n        const Button = withRouter(({ history }) => (\n          <button\n            type=\"button\"\n            onClick={() => {\n              history.push(\"/new-location\");\n            }}\n          >\n            {\"Click Me!\"}\n          </button>\n        ));\n        ```javascript\n\n    2.  **Using `<Route>` component and render props pattern:**\n\n        The `<Route>` component passes the same props as `withRouter()`, so you will be able to access the history methods through the history prop.\n\n        ```jsx harmony\n        import { Route } from \"react-router-dom\";\n\n        const Button = () => (\n          <Route\n            render={({ history }) => (\n              <button\n                type=\"button\"\n                onClick={() => {\n                  history.push(\"/new-location\");\n                }}\n              >\n                {\"Click Me!\"}\n              </button>\n            )}\n          />\n        );\n        ```javascript\n\n    3.  **Using context:**\n\n        This option is not recommended and treated as unstable API.\n\n        ```jsx harmony\n        const Button = (props, context) => (\n          <button\n            type=\"button\"\n            onClick={() => {\n              context.history.push(\"/new-location\");\n            }}\n          >\n            {\"Click Me!\"}\n          </button>\n        );\n\n        Button.contextTypes = {\n          history: React.PropTypes.shape({\n            push: React.PropTypes.func.isRequired,\n          }),\n        };\n        ```"

    "answer": "**Flux** is an **application architecture** (not a framework or library) designed by Facebook to manage **data flow** in React applications. It was created as an alternative to the traditional **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** pattern, and it emphasizes a **unidirectional data flow** to make state changes more predictable and easier to debug.\n\n       Flux complements React by organizing the way data moves through your application, especially in large-scale or complex projects.\n\n       #### Core Concepts of Flux\n\n       Flux operates using **four key components**, each with a specific responsibility:\n       *   **Actions**\n             *   Plain JavaScript objects or functions that describe _what happened_ (e.g., user interactions or API responses).\n             *   Example: `{ type: 'ADD_TODO', payload: 'Buy milk' }`\n       *   **Dispatcher**\n             *   A central hub that receives actions and **dispatches** them to the appropriate stores.\n             *   There is **only one dispatcher** in a Flux application.\n       *   **Stores**\n             *   Hold the **application state** and business logic.\n             *   Respond to actions from the dispatcher and update themselves accordingly.\n             *   They **emit change events** that views can listen to.\n       *   **Views (React Components)**\n             *   Subscribe to stores and **re-render** when the data changes.\n             *   They can also trigger new actions (e.g., on user input).\n\n\n       The workflow between dispatcher, stores and views components with distinct inputs and outputs as follows:\n\n       ![flux](images/flux.png)"

    "answer": "Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications, most commonly used with React.

Redux core is tiny library(about 2.5kB gzipped) and has no dependencies."

    "title": "What are the core principles of Redux?",
    "answer": "Redux follows three fundamental principles:\n\n     1. **Single source of truth:** The state of your whole application is stored in an object tree within a single store. The single state tree makes it easier to keep track of changes over time and debug or inspect the application.\n   \n      ```jsx\n      const store = createStore(reducer);\n      ```javascript\n     2. **State is read-only:** The only way to change the state is to emit an action, an object describing what happened. This ensures that neither the views nor the network callbacks will ever write directly to the state.\n      ```js\n      const action = { type: 'INCREMENT' };\n      store.dispatch(action);\n      ```javascript\n     3. **Changes are made with pure functions(Reducers):** To specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, you write reducers. Reducers are just pure functions that take the previous state and an action as parameters, and return the next state.\n      \n      ```jsx\n      function counter(state = 0, action) {\n        switch (action.type) {\n          case 'INCREMENT':\n            return state + 1;\n          case 'DECREMENT':\n            return state - 1;\n          default:\n            return state;\n        }\n      }\n      ```"

    "title": "What are the downsides of Redux compared to Flux?",
    "answer": "While Redux offers a powerful and predictable state management solution, it comes with a few trade-offs when compared to Flux. These include:\n\n     1.  **Immutability is essential**  \n        Redux enforces a strict immutability model for state updates, which differs from Flux’s more relaxed approach. This means you must avoid mutating state directly. Many Redux-related libraries assume immutability, so your team must be disciplined in writing pure update logic. You can use tools like `redux-immutable-state-invariant`, `Immer`, or `Immutable.js` to help enforce this practice, especially during development.\n     2.  **Careful selection of complementary packages**  \n        Redux is more minimal by design and provides extension points such as middleware and store enhancers. This has led to a large ecosystem, but it also means you must thoughtfully choose and configure additional packages for features like undo/redo, persistence, or form handling—something Flux explicitly leaves out but may be simpler to manage in smaller setups.\n     3.  **Limited static type integration**  \n        While Flux has mature support for static type checking with tools like Flow, Redux’s type integration is less seamless. Although TypeScript is commonly used with Redux now, early Flow support was limited, and more boilerplate was required for static type safety. This may affect teams that rely heavily on type systems for large codebases."

It is usually used as an architecture for UIs. Think of it as an alternative to (half of) Angular. RxJS is a reactive programming library. It is usually used as a tool to accomplish asynchronous tasks in JavaScript. Think of it as an alternative to Promises. Redux uses the Reactive paradigm because the Store is reactive. The Store observes actions from a distance, and changes itself. RxJS also uses the Reactive paradigm, but instead of being an architecture, it gives you basic building blocks, Observables, to accomplish this pattern."

    "answer": "You need to write a _root reducer_ in your application which delegate handling the action to the reducer generated by `combineReducers()`.\n\n     For example, let us take `rootReducer()` to return the initial state after `USER_LOGOUT` action. As we know, reducers are supposed to return the initial state when they are called with `undefined` as the first argument, no matter the action.\n\n     ```javascript\n     const appReducer = combineReducers({\n       /* your app's top-level reducers */\n     });\n\n     const rootReducer = (state, action) => {\n       if (action.type === \"USER_LOGOUT\") {\n         state = undefined;\n       }\n\n       return appReducer(state, action);\n     };\n     ```javascript\n\n     In case of using `redux-persist`, you may also need to clean your storage. `redux-persist` keeps a copy of your state in a storage engine. First, you need to import the appropriate storage engine and then, to parse the state before setting it to undefined and clean each storage state key.\n\n     ```javascript\n     const appReducer = combineReducers({\n       /* your app's top-level reducers */\n     });\n\n     const rootReducer = (state, action) => {\n       if (action.type === \"USER_LOGOUT\") {\n         Object.keys(state).forEach((key) => {\n           storage.removeItem(`persist:${key}`);\n         });\n\n         state = undefined;\n       }\n\n       return appReducer(state, action);\n     };\n     ```"

    "answer": "The best way to access your store in a component is to use the `connect()` function, that creates a new component that wraps around your existing one. This pattern is called _Higher-Order Components_, and is generally the preferred way of extending a component's functionality in React. This allows you to map state and action creators to your component, and have them passed in automatically as your store updates.\n\n     Let's take an example of `<FilterLink>` component using connect:\n\n     ```javascript\n     import { connect } from \"react-redux\";\n     import { setVisibilityFilter } from \"../actions\";\n     import Link from \"../components/Link\";\n\n     const mapStateToProps = (state, ownProps) => ({\n       active: ownProps.filter === state.visibilityFilter,\n     });\n\n     const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch, ownProps) => ({\n       onClick: () => dispatch(setVisibilityFilter(ownProps.filter)),\n     });\n\n     const FilterLink = connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(Link);\n\n     export default FilterLink;\n     ```javascript\n\n     Due to it having quite a few performance optimizations and generally being less likely to cause bugs, the Redux developers almost always recommend using `connect()` over accessing the store directly (using context API).\n\n     ```javascript\n     function MyComponent {\n       someMethod() {\n         doSomethingWith(this.context.store);\n       }\n     }\n     ```"

    "title": "What is Redux Thunk?",
    "answer": "_Redux Thunk_ middleware allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action. The thunk can be used to delay the dispatch of an action, or to dispatch only if a certain condition is met. The inner function receives the store methods `dispatch()` and `getState()` as parameters."

    "answer": "Both _Redux Thunk_ and _Redux Saga_ take care of dealing with side effects. In most of the scenarios, Thunk uses _Promises_ to deal with them, whereas Saga uses _Generators_. Thunk is simple to use and Promises are familiar to many developers, Sagas/Generators are more powerful but you will need to learn them. But both middleware can coexist, so you can start with Thunks and introduce Sagas when/if you need them."

    "answer": "The concept of render hijacking is the ability to control what a component will output from another component. It means that you decorate your component by wrapping it into a Higher-Order component. By wrapping, you can inject additional props or make other changes, which can cause changing logic of rendering. It does not actually enable hijacking, but by using HOC you make your component behave differently."

    "answer": "Should I ever use react internal state?\n\nIt is up to the developer's decision, i.e., it is developer's job to determine what kinds of state make up your application, and where each piece of state should live. Some users prefer to keep every single piece of data in Redux, to maintain a fully serializable and controlled version of their application at all times. Others prefer to keep non-critical or UI state, such as “is this dropdown currently open”, inside a component's internal state.\n\n     Below are the rules of thumb to determine what kind of data should be put into Redux\n\n     1. Do other parts of the application care about this data?\n     2. Do you need to be able to create further derived data based on this original data?\n     3. Is the same data being used to drive multiple components?\n     4. Is there value to you in being able to restore this state to a given point in time (ie, time travel debugging)?\n     5. Do you want to cache the data (i.e, use what's in state if it's already there instead of re-requesting it)?"

    "title": "What rules need to be followed for hooks?",
    "answer": "You need to follow two rules in order to use hooks,\n\n     1. **Call Hooks only at the top level of your react functions:** You should always use hooks at the top level of react function before any early returns. i.e, You shouldn’t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions. This will ensure that Hooks are called in the same order each time a component renders and it preserves the state of Hooks between multiple re-renders due to `useState` and `useEffect` calls.\n\n     Let's see the difference using an example,\n     **Correct usage:**:\n     ```jsx\n     function UserProfile() {\n      // Correct: Hooks called at the top level\n      const [name, setName] = useState('John');\n      const [country, setCountry] = useState('US');\n\n      return (\n        <div>\n          <h1>Name: {name}</h1>\n          <p>Country: {country}</p>\n        </div>\n      );\n     }\n     ```javascript\n     **Incorrect usage:**:\n     ```jsx\n     function UserProfile() {\n      const [name, setName] = useState('John');\n\n      if (name === 'John') {\n        // Incorrect: useState is called inside a conditional\n        const [country, setCountry] = useState('US'); \n      }\n\n      return (\n        <div>\n          <h1>Name: {name}</h1>\n          <p>Country: {country}</p> {/* This will throw an error if the name condition isn't met */}\n        </div>\n      );\n     }\n     ```javascript\n     The `useState` hook for the country field is being called conditionally within an `if` block. This can lead to inconsistent state behavior and may cause hooks to be called in a different order on each re-render.\n\n     2. **Call Hooks from React Functions only:** You shouldn’t call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions or class components. Instead, you should call them from either function components or custom hooks.\n\n     Let's find the difference of correct and incorrect usage with below examples,\n\n     **Correct usage:**:\n     ```jsx\n     //Example1:\n     function Counter() {\n      // Correct: useState is used inside a functional component\n      const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n      return <div>Counter: {count}</div>;\n     }\n     //Example2:\n     function useFetchData(url) {\n      const [data, setData] = useState(null);\n\n      useEffect(() => {\n        fetch(url)\n          .then((response) => response.json())\n          .then((data) => setData(data));\n      }, [url]);\n\n      return data;\n     }\n\n     function UserProfile() {\n      // Correct: Using a custom hook here\n      const user = useFetchData('https://some-api.com/user');\n\n      return (\n        <div>\n          <h1>{user ? user.name : 'Loading profile...'}</h1>\n        </div>\n      );\n     }\n     ```javascript\n     **Incorrect usage:**:\n     ```jsx\n      //Example1\n      function normalFunction() {\n        // Incorrect: Can't call hooks in normal functions\n        const [count, setCount] = useState(0); \n      }\n\n      //Example2\n      function fetchData(url) {\n        // Incorrect: Hooks can't be used in non-React functions\n        const [data, setData] = useState(null);\n\n        useEffect(() => {\n          fetch(url)\n            .then((response) => response.json())\n            .then((data) => setData(data));\n        }, [url]);\n\n        return data;\n      }\n     ```javascript\n     In the above incorrect usage example, both `useState` and `useEffect` are used in non-React functions(`normalFunction` and `fetchData`), which is not allowed."

It ensures that the dependencies of useEffect, useCallback, and useMemo hooks are correctly listed to avoid potential bugs.\n\n        ```jsx\n        useEffect(() => {\n          // Forgetting `message` will result in incorrect behavior\n          console.log(message);\n        }, []); // Here `message` should be a dependency\n        ```javascript\n        The recommended `eslint-config-react-app` preset already includes the hooks rules of this plugin.\n        For example, the linter enforce proper naming convention for hooks. If you rename your custom hooks which as prefix \"use\" to something else then linter won't allow you to call built-in hooks such as useState, useEffect etc inside of your custom hook anymore.\n\n        **Note:** This plugin is intended to use in Create React App by default."

The react project supports code splitting via dynamic import() feature.\n\n     For example, in the below code snippets, it will make moduleA.js and all its unique dependencies as a separate chunk that only loads after the user clicks the 'Load' button.\n\n     **moduleA.js**\n\n     ```javascript\n     const moduleA = \"Hello\";\n\n     export { moduleA };\n     ```javascript\n\n     **App.js**\n\n     ```javascript\n     export default function App {\n       function handleClick() {\n         import(\"./moduleA\")\n           .then(({ moduleA }) => {\n             // Use moduleA\n           })\n           .catch((err) => {\n             // Handle failure\n           });\n       };\n\n      return (\n        <div>\n          <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Load</button>\n        </div>\n      );\n     }\n     ```javascript\n\n  <details><summary><b>See Class</b></summary>\n    <p>\n\n  ```javascript\n    import React, { Component } from \"react\";\n\n     class App extends Component {\n       handleClick = () => {\n         import(\"./moduleA\")\n           .then(({ moduleA }) => {\n             // Use moduleA\n           })\n           .catch((err) => {\n             // Handle failure\n           });\n       };\n\n       render() {\n         return (\n           <div>\n             <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Load</button>\n           </div>\n         );\n       }\n     }\n\n     export default App;\n  ```javascript\n\n  </p>\n</details>"

However, prior to React 18, it was recommended to use Loadable Components for code-splitting in a server-side rendered app because React.lazy and Suspense were not available for server-side rendering. Loadable Components lets you render a dynamic import as a regular component. For example, you can use Loadable Components to load the OtherComponent in a separate bundle like this:\n\n     ```javascript\n     import loadable from \"@loadable/component\";\n\n     const OtherComponent = loadable(() => import(\"./OtherComponent\"));\n\n     function MyComponent() {\n       return (\n         <div>\n           <OtherComponent />\n         </div>\n       );\n     }\n     ```javascript\n\n     Now OtherComponent will be loaded in a separated bundle\n     Loadable Components provides additional benefits beyond just code-splitting, such as automatic code reloading, error handling, and preloading. By using Loadable Components, you can ensure that your application loads quickly and efficiently, providing a better user experience for your users."

Lazy loading components uses suspense feature,\n\n\n        If the module containing the dynamic import is not yet loaded by the time parent component renders, you must show some fallback content while you’re waiting for it to load using a loading indicator. This can be done using **Suspense** component.\n    \n        ```javascript\n        const OtherComponent = React.lazy(() => import(\"./OtherComponent\"));\n\n        function MyComponent() {\n          return (\n            <div>\n              <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>\n                <OtherComponent />\n              </Suspense>\n            </div>\n          );\n        }\n        ```javascript\n        The above component shows fallback UI instead real component until `OtherComponent` is fully loaded.\n\n     2.

However, the algorithms have a complexity in the order of O(n³) where n is the number of elements in the tree.\n\n     In this case, displaying 1000 elements would require in the order of one billion comparisons. This is far too expensive. Instead, React implements a heuristic O(n) algorithm based on two assumptions:\n\n     1. Two elements of different types will produce different trees.\n     2. The developer can hint at which child elements may be stable across different renders with a key prop."

    "title": "What are the rules covered by diffing algorithm?",
    "answer": "When diffing two trees, React first compares the two root elements. The behavior is different depending on the types of the root elements. It covers the below rules during reconciliation algorithm,\n\n     1. **Elements Of Different Types:**\n        Whenever the root elements have different types, React will tear down the old tree and build the new tree from scratch. For example, elements <a> to <img>, or from <Article> to <Comment> of different types lead a full rebuild.\n     2. **DOM Elements Of The Same Type:**\n        When comparing two React DOM elements of the same type, React looks at the attributes of both, keeps the same underlying DOM node, and only updates the changed attributes. Lets take an example with same DOM elements except className attribute,\n\n        ```javascript\n        <div className=\"show\" title=\"ReactJS\" />\n\n        <div className=\"hide\" title=\"ReactJS\" />\n        ```javascript\n\n     3. **Component Elements Of The Same Type:**\n        When a component updates, the instance stays the same, so that state is maintained across renders. React updates the props of the underlying component instance to match the new element, and calls componentWillReceiveProps() and componentWillUpdate() on the underlying instance. After that, the render() method is called and the diff algorithm recurses on the previous result and the new result.\n     4. **Recursing On Children:**\n        when recursing on the children of a DOM node, React just iterates over both lists of children at the same time and generates a mutation whenever there’s a difference. For example, when adding an element at the end of the children, converting between these two trees works well.\n\n        ```javascript\n        <ul>\n          <li>first</li>\n          <li>second</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <ul>\n          <li>first</li>\n          <li>second</li>\n          <li>third</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        ```javascript\n\n     5. **Handling keys:**\n        React supports a key attribute. When children have keys, React uses the key to match children in the original tree with children in the subsequent tree. For example, adding a key can make the tree conversion efficient,\n\n     ```javascript\n     <ul>\n       <li key=\"2015\">Duke</li>\n       <li key=\"2016\">Villanova</li>\n     </ul>\n\n     <ul>\n       <li key=\"2014\">Connecticut</li>\n       <li key=\"2015\">Duke</li>\n       <li key=\"2016\">Villanova</li>\n     </ul>\n     ```"

    "title": "Must prop be named as render for render props?",
    "answer": "Even though the pattern named render props, you don’t have to use a prop named render to use this pattern. i.e, Any prop that is a function that a component uses to know what to render is technically a “render prop”. Lets take an example with the children prop for render props,\n\n     ```javascript\n     <Mouse\n       children={(mouse) => (\n         <p>\n           The mouse position is {mouse.x}, {mouse.y}\n         </p>\n       )}\n     />\n     ```javascript\n\n     Actually children prop doesn’t need to be named in the list of “attributes” in JSX element. Instead, you can keep it directly inside element,\n\n     ```javascript\n     <Mouse>\n       {(mouse) => (\n         <p>\n           The mouse position is {mouse.x}, {mouse.y}\n         </p>\n       )}\n     </Mouse>\n     ```javascript\n\n     While using this above technique(without any name), explicitly state that children should be a function in your propTypes.\n\n     ```javascript\n     Mouse.propTypes = {\n       children: PropTypes.func.isRequired,\n     };\n     ```"

    "answer": "If you create a function inside a render method, it negates the purpose of pure component. Because the shallow prop comparison will always return false for new props, and each render in this case will generate a new value for the render prop. You can solve this issue by defining the render function as instance method."

    "answer": "Windowing is a technique that only renders a small subset of your rows at any given time, and can dramatically reduce the time it takes to re-render the components as well as the number of DOM nodes created. If your application renders long lists of data then this technique is recommended. Both react-window and react-virtualized are popular windowing libraries which provides several reusable components for displaying lists, grids, and tabular data."

    "title": "What is the typical use case of portals?",
    "answer": "React Portals are primarily used to render UI components such as **modals, tooltips, dropdowns, hovercards, and notifications** outside of their parent component's DOM tree. This helps avoid common CSS issues caused by parent elements, such as:\n\n     *   `**overflow: hidden**` on parent elements clipping or hiding child elements like modals or tooltips,\n     *   **stacking context and** `**z-index**` **conflicts** created by parent containers that prevent child elements from appearing above other content.\n\n     That means, you need to visually “break out” of its container. By rendering these UI elements into a separate DOM node (often directly under `<body>`), portals ensure they appear above all other content and are not restricted by the parent’s CSS or layout constraints, resulting in correct positioning and visibility regardless of the parent’s styling."

    "answer": "In React, the value attribute on form elements will override the value in the DOM. With an uncontrolled component, you might want React to specify the initial value, but leave subsequent updates uncontrolled. To handle this case, you can specify a **defaultValue** attribute instead of **value**.\n\n     ```javascript\n     render() {\n       return (\n         <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>\n           <label>\n             User Name:\n             <input\n               defaultValue=\"John\"\n               type=\"text\"\n               ref={this.input} />\n           </label>\n           <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\" />\n         </form>\n       );\n     }\n     ```javascript\n\n     The same applies for `select` and `textArea` inputs.

    "answer": "How to fetch data with React Hooks?\n\nThe `useEffect` hook is a React Hook that lets you perform **side effects** in function components. Side effects are operations that interact with the outside world or system and aren't directly related to rendering UI — such as fetching data, setting up subscriptions, timers, manually manipulating the DOM, etc.\n\n     In function components, useEffect replaces the class component lifecycle methods(`componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate` and `componentWillUnmount`) with a single, unified API.     \n\n     **Syntax**\n     ```js\n     useEffect(() => {\n        // Side effect logic here\n\n        return () => {\n        // Cleanup logic (optional)\n        };\n        }, [dependencies]);\n     ```javascript\n     This effect hook can be used to fetch data from an API and to set the data in the local state of the component with the useState hook’s update function.\n\n     Here is an example of fetching a list of ReactJS articles from an API using fetch.\n\n     ```javascript\n     import React from \"react\";\n\n     function App() {\n       const [data, setData] = React.useState({ hits: [] });\n\n       React.useEffect(() => {\n         fetch(\"http://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/search?query=react\")\n           .then((response) => response.json())\n           .then((data) => setData(data));\n       }, []);\n\n       return (\n         <ul>\n           {data.hits.map((item) => (\n             <li key={item.objectID}>\n               <a href={item.url}>{item.title}</a>\n             </li>\n           ))}\n         </ul>\n       );\n     }\n\n     export default App;\n     ```javascript\n\n     A popular way to simplify this is by using the library axios.\n\n     We provided an empty array as second argument to the useEffect hook to avoid activating it on component updates. This way, it only fetches on component mount."

Using [0] and [1] to access them is a bit confusing because they have a specific meaning. This is why we use array destructuring instead.\n\n     For example, the array index access would look as follows:\n\n     ```javascript\n     var userStateVariable = useState(\"userProfile\"); // Returns an array pair\n     var user = userStateVariable[0]; // Access first item\n     var setUser = userStateVariable[1]; // Access second item\n     ```javascript\n\n     Whereas with array destructuring the variables can be accessed as follows:\n\n     ```javascript\n     const [user, setUser] = useState(\"userProfile\");\n     ```"

You can enable this in two ways,\n\n     ```javascript\n     // 1. Part of an app by wrapping with ConcurrentMode\n     <React.unstable_ConcurrentMode>\n       <Something />\n     </React.unstable_ConcurrentMode>;\n\n     // 2.

    "answer": "Imagine a simple UI component, such as a \"Like\" button. When you tap it, it turns blue if it was previously grey, and grey if it was previously blue.\n\n     The imperative way of doing this would be:\n\n     ```javascript\n     if (user.likes()) {\n       if (hasBlue()) {\n         removeBlue();\n         addGrey();\n       } else {\n         removeGrey();\n         addBlue();\n       }\n     }\n     ```javascript\n\n     Basically, you have to check what is currently on the screen and handle all the changes necessary to redraw it with the current state, including undoing the changes from the previous state. You can imagine how complex this could be in a real-world scenario.\n\n     In contrast, the declarative approach would be:\n\n     ```javascript\n     if (this.state.liked) {\n       return <blueLike />;\n     } else {\n       return <greyLike />;\n     }\n     ```javascript\n\n     Because the declarative approach separates concerns, this part of it only needs to handle how the UI should look in a specific state, and is therefore much simpler to understand."

    "answer": "A wrapper in React is a component that wraps or surrounds another component or group of components. It can be used for a variety of purposes such as adding additional functionality, styling, or layout to the wrapped components.\n\n     For example, consider a simple component that displays a message:\n\n     ```javascript\n     const Message = ({ text }) => {\n       return <p>{text}</p>;\n     };\n     ```javascript\n\n     We can create a wrapper component that will add a border to the message component:\n\n     ```javascript\n     const MessageWrapper = (props) => {\n       return (\n         <div style={{ border: \"1px solid black\" }}>\n           <Message {...props} />\n         </div>\n       );\n     };\n     ```javascript\n\n     Now we can use the MessageWrapper component instead of the Message component and the message will be displayed with a border:\n\n     ```javascript\n     <MessageWrapper text=\"Hello World\" />\n     ```javascript\n\n     Wrapper component can also accept its own props and pass them down to the wrapped component, for example, we can create a wrapper component that will add a title to the message component:\n\n     ```javascript\n     const MessageWrapperWithTitle = ({ title, ...props }) => {\n       return (\n         <div>\n           <h3>{title}</h3>\n           <Message {...props} />\n         </div>\n       );\n     };\n     ```javascript\n\n     Now we can use the MessageWrapperWithTitle component and pass title props:\n\n     ```javascript\n     <MessageWrapperWithTitle title=\"My Message\" text=\"Hello World\" />\n     ```javascript\n\n     This way, the wrapper component can add additional functionality, styling, or layout to the wrapped component while keeping the wrapped component simple and reusable."

    "title": "What are the differences between useEffect and useLayoutEffect hooks?",
    "answer": "useEffect and useLayoutEffect are both React hooks that can be used to synchronize a component with an external system, such as a browser API or a third-party library. However, there are some key differences between the two:\n\n     - Timing: useEffect runs after the browser has finished painting, while useLayoutEffect runs synchronously before the browser paints. This means that useLayoutEffect can be used to measure and update layout in a way that feels more synchronous to the user.\n\n     - Browser Paint: useEffect allows browser to paint the changes before running the effect, hence it may cause some visual flicker. useLayoutEffect synchronously runs the effect before browser paints and hence it will avoid visual flicker.\n\n     - Execution Order: The order in which multiple useEffect hooks are executed is determined by React and may not be predictable. However, the order in which multiple useLayoutEffect hooks are executed is determined by the order in which they were called.\n\n     - Error handling: useEffect has a built-in mechanism for handling errors that occur during the execution of the effect, so that it does not crash the entire application. useLayoutEffect does not have this mechanism, and errors that occur during the execution of the effect will crash the entire application.\n\n     In general, it's recommended to use useEffect as much as possible, because it is more performant and less prone to errors. useLayoutEffect should only be used when you need to measure or update layout, and you can't achieve the same result using useEffect."

    "title": "What are the differences between Functional and Class Components?",
    "answer": "There are two different ways to create components in ReactJS. The main differences are listed down as below,\n\n     ## 1. Syntax:\n\n     The class components uses ES6 classes to create the components. It uses `render` function to display the HTML content in the webpage.\n\n     The syntax for class component looks like as below.\n\n     ```js\n     class App extends React.Component {\n       render() {\n         return <h1>This is a class component</h1>;\n       }\n     }\n     ```javascript\n\n     **Note:** The **Pascal Case** is the recommended approach to provide naming to a component.\n\n     Functional component has been improved over the years with some added features like Hooks. Here is a syntax for functional component.\n\n     ```js\n     function App() {\n       return (\n         <div className=\"App\">\n           <h1>Hello, I'm a function component</h1>\n         </div>\n       );\n     }\n     ```javascript\n\n     ## 2. State:\n\n     State contains information or data about a component which may change over time.\n\n     In class component, you can update the state when a user interacts with it or server updates the data using the `setState()` method. The initial state is going to be assigned in the `Constructor()` method using the `this.state` object and it is possible to assign different data types such as string, boolean, numbers, etc.\n\n     **A simple example showing how we use the setState() and constructor():**\n\n     ```js\n     class App extends Component {\n       constructor() {\n         super();\n         this.state = {\n           message: \"This is a class component\",\n         };\n       }\n       updateMessage() {\n         this.setState({\n           message: \"Updating the class component\",\n         });\n       }\n       render() {\n         return (\n           <>\n             <h1>{this.state.message}</h1>\n             <button\n               onClick={() => {\n                 this.updateMessage();\n               }}>\n               Click!!\n             </button>\n           </>\n         );\n       }\n     }\n\n     ```javascript\n\n     You didn't use state in functional components because it was only supported in class components. But over the years hooks have been implemented in functional components which enables to use state too.\n\n     The `useState()` hook can used to implement state in functional components. It returns an array with two items: the first item is current state and the next one is a function (setState) that updates the value of the current state.\n\n     Let's see an example to demonstrate the state in functional components,\n\n     ```js\n     function App() {\n       const [message, setMessage] = useState(\"This is a functional component\");\n       const updateMessage = () => {\n         setMessage(\"Updating the functional component\");\n       };\n       return (\n         <div className=\"App\">\n           <h1>{message} </h1>\n           <button onClick={updateMessage}>Click me!!</button>\n         </div>\n       );\n     }\n     ```javascript\n\n     ## 3. Props:\n\n     Props are referred to as \"properties\". The props are passed into React component just like arguments passed to a function. In other words, they are similar to HTML attributes.\n\n     The props are accessible in child class component using `this.props` as shown in below example,\n\n     ```js\n     class Child extends React.Component {\n       render() {\n         return (\n           <h1>\n             {\" \"}\n             This is a functional component and component name is {\n               this.props.name\n             }{\" \"}\n           </h1>\n         );\n       }\n     }\n\n     class Parent extends React.Component {\n       render() {\n         return (\n           <div className=\"Parent\">\n             <Child name=\"First child component\" />\n             <Child name=\"Second child component\" />\n           </div>\n         );\n       }\n     }\n     ```javascript\n\n     Props in functional components are similar to that of the class components but the difference is the absence of 'this' keyword.\n\n     ```js\n     function Child(props) {\n       return (\n         <h1>\n           This is a child component and the component name is{props.name}\n         </h1>\n       );\n     }\n\n     function Parent() {\n       return (\n         <div className=\"Parent\">\n           <Child name=\"First child component\" />\n           <Child name=\"Second child component\" />\n         </div>\n       );\n     }\n     ```"

For example, the following code snippet renders `App` component on root DOM node.\n\n        ```jsx\n        import { createRoot } from \"react-dom/client\";\n\n        const root = createRoot(document.getElementById(\"root\"));\n        root.render(<App />);\n        ```javascript\n\n        2. **Re-render when the state updated:** When you update the component state using the state setter function, the componen't state automatically queues for a render.\n\n     2. **Rendering components:** After triggering a render, React will call your components to display them on the screen. React will call the root component for initial render and call the function component whose state update triggered the render. This is a recursive process for all nested components of the target component.\n\n     3. **Commit changes to DOM:** After calling components, React will modify the DOM for initial render using `appendChild()` DOM API and apply minimal necessary DOM updates for re-renders based on differences between rerenders."

    "title": "How does React batch multiple state updates?",
    "answer": "React prevents component from re-rendering for each and every state update by grouping multiple state updates within an event handler. This strategy improves the application performance and this process known as **batching**. The older version of React only supported batching for browser events whereas React18 supported for asynchronous actions, timeouts and intervals along with native events. This improved version of batching is called **automatic batching**.\n\n      Let's demonstrate this automatic batching feature with a below example.\n\n      ```jsx\n      import { useState } from \"react\";\n\n      export default function BatchingState() {\n        const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n        const [message, setMessage] = useState(\"batching\");\n\n        console.log(\"Application Rendered\");\n\n        const handleAsyncFetch = () => {\n          fetch(\"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1\").then(() => {\n            // Automatic Batching re-render only once\n            setCount(count + 1);\n            setMessage(\"users fetched\");\n          });\n        };\n\n        return (\n          <>\n            <h1>{count}</h1>\n            <button onClick={handleAsyncFetch}>Click Me!</button>\n          </>\n        );\n      }\n      ```javascript\n\n      The preceding code updated two state variables with in an event handler. However, React will perform automatic batching feature and the component will be re-rendered only once for better performance."

    "title": "Is it possible to prevent automatic batching?",
    "answer": "Yes, it is possible to prevent automatic batching default behavior. There might be cases where you need to re-render your component after each state update or updating one state depends on another state variable. Considering this situation, React introduced `flushSync` method from `react-dom` API for the usecases where you need to flush state updates to DOM immediately.\n\n      The usage of `flushSync` method within an `onClick` event handler will be looking like as below,\n\n      ```jsx\n      import { flushSync } from \"react-dom\";\n\n      const handleClick = () => {\n        flushSync(() => {\n          setClicked(!clicked); //Component will create a re-render here\n        });\n\n        setCount(count + 1); // Component will create a re-render again here\n      };\n      ```javascript\n\n      In the above click handler, React will update DOM at first using flushSync and second time updates DOM because of the counter setter function by avoiding automatic batching."

    "answer": "React hydration is used to add client-side JavaScript interactivity to pre-rendered static HTML generated by the server. It is used only for server-side rendering(SSR) to enhance the initial rendering time and make it SEO friendly application. This hydration acts as a bridge to reduce the gap between server side and client-side rendering.\n\n      After the page loaded with generated static HTML, React will add application state and interactivity by attaching all event handlers for the respective elements. Let's demonstrate this with an example.\n\n      Consider that React DOM API(using `renderToString`) generated HTML for `<App>` component which contains `<button>` element to increment the counter.\n\n      ```jsx\n      import {useState} from 'react';\n      import { renderToString } from 'react-dom/server';\n\n      export default function App() {\n        const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);\n\n        return (\n          <h1>Counter</h1>\n          <button onClick={() => setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1)}>\n            {count} times\n          </button>\n          );\n      }\n\n      const html = renderToString(<App />);\n      ```javascript\n\n      The above code generates the below HTML with a header text and button component without any interactivity.\n\n      ```html\n      <h1>Counter</h1>\n      <button>\n        <!-- -->0<!-- -->\n        times\n      </button>\n      ```javascript\n\n      At this stage `hydrateRoot` API can be used to perform hydration by attaching `onClick` event handler.\n\n      ```jsx\n      import { hydrateRoot } from \"react-dom/client\";\n      import App from \"./App.js\";\n\n      hydrateRoot(document.getElementById(\"root\"), <App />);\n      ```javascript\n\n      After this step, you are able to run React application on server-side and hydrating the javascript bundle on client-side for smooth user experience and SEO purposes."

    "title": "How do you update objects inside state?",
    "answer": "You cannot update the objects which exists in the state directly. Instead, you should create a fresh new object (or copy from the existing object) and update the latest state using the newly created object. Eventhough JavaScript objects are mutable, you need to treat objects inside state as read-only while updating the state.\n\n      Let's see this comparison with an example. The issue with regular object mutation approach can be described by updating the user details fields of `Profile` component. The properties of `Profile` component such as firstName, lastName and age details mutated in an event handler as shown below.\n\n      ```jsx\n      import { useState } from \"react\";\n\n      export default function Profile() {\n        const [user, setUser] = useState({\n          firstName: \"John\",\n          lastName: \"Abraham\",\n          age: 30,\n        });\n\n        function handleFirstNameChange(e) {\n          user.firstName = e.target.value;\n        }\n\n        function handleLastNameChange(e) {\n          user.lastName = e.target.value;\n        }\n\n        function handleAgeChange(e) {\n          user.age = e.target.value;\n        }\n\n        return (\n          <>\n            <label>\n              First name:\n              <input value={user.firstName} onChange={handleFirstNameChange} />\n            </label>\n            <label>\n              Last name:\n              <input value={user.lastName} onChange={handleLastNameChange} />\n            </label>\n            <label>\n              Age:\n              <input value={user.age} onChange={handleAgeChange} />\n            </label>\n            <p>\n              Profile:\n              {person.firstName} {person.lastName} ({person.age})\n            </p>\n          </>\n        );\n      }\n      ```javascript\n\n      Once you run the application with above user profile component, you can observe that user profile details won't be update upon entering the input fields.\n      This issue can be fixed by creating a new copy of object which includes existing properties through spread syntax(...obj) and add changed values in a single event handler itself as shown below.\n\n      ```jsx\n      handleProfileChange(e) {\n        setUser({\n        ...user,\n          [e.target.name]: e.target.value\n        });\n      }\n      ```javascript\n\n      The above event handler is concise instead of maintaining separate event handler for each field. Now, UI displays the updated field values as expected without an issue."

    "title": "How do you update nested objects inside state?",
    "answer": "You cannot simply use spread syntax for all kinds of objects inside state. Because spread syntax is shallow and it copies properties for one level deep only. If the object has nested object structure, UI doesn't work as expected with regular JavaScript nested property mutation. Let's demonstrate this behavior with an example of User object which has address nested object inside of it.\n\n      ```jsx\n      const user = {\n        name: \"John\",\n        age: 32,\n        address: {\n          country: \"Singapore\",\n          postalCode: 440004,\n        },\n      };\n      ```javascript\n\n      If you try to update the country nested field in a regular javascript fashion(as shown below) then user profile screen won't be updated with latest value.\n\n      ```js\n      user.address.country = \"Germany\";\n      ```javascript\n\n      This issue can be fixed by flattening all the fields into a top-level object or create a new object for each nested object and point it to it's parent object. In this example, first you need to create copy of address object and update it with the latest value. Later, the address object should be linked to parent user object something like below.\n\n      ```js\n      setUser({\n        ...user,\n        address: {\n          ...user.address,\n          country: \"Germany\",\n        },\n      });\n      ```javascript\n\n      This approach is bit verbose and not easy for deep hierarchical state updates. But this workaround can be used for few levels of nested objects without much hassle."

    "title": "How do you update arrays inside state?",
    "answer": "Eventhough arrays in JavaScript are mutable in nature, you need to treat them as immutable while storing them in a state. That means, similar to objects, the arrays cannot be updated directly inside state. Instead, you need to create a copy of the existing array and then set the state to use newly copied array.\n\n      To ensure that arrays are not mutated, the mutation operations like direct direct assignment(arr[1]='one'), push, pop, shift, unshift, splice etc methods should be avoided on original array. Instead, you can create a copy of existing array with help of array operations such as filter, map, slice, spread syntax etc.\n\n      For example, the below push operation doesn't add the new todo to the total todo's list in an event handler.\n\n      ```jsx\n      onClick = {\n        todos.push({\n          id: id+1,\n          name: name\n        })\n      }\n      ```javascript\n\n      This issue is fixed by replacing push operation with spread syntax where it will create a new array and the UI updated with new todo.\n\n      ```jsx\n      onClick = {\n        [\n          ...todos,\n          { id: id+1, name: name }\n        ]\n      }\n      ```"

    "title": "How do you use immer library for state updates?",
    "answer": "Immer library enforces the immutability of state based on **copy-on-write** mechanism. It uses JavaScript proxy to keep track of updates to immutable states. Immer has 3 main states as below,\n\n      1. **Current state:** It refers to actual state\n      2. **Draft state:** All new changes will be applied to this state. In this state, draft is just a proxy of the current state.\n      3. **Next state:** It is formed after all mutations applied to the draft state\n\n      Immer can be used by following below instructions,\n\n      1. Install the dependency using `npm install use-immer` command\n      2. Replace `useState` hook with `useImmer` hook by importing at the top\n      3. The setter function of `useImmer` hook can be used to update the state.\n\n      For example, the mutation syntax of immer library simplifies the nested address object of user state as follows,\n\n      ```jsx\n      import { useImmer } from \"use-immer\";\n      const [user, setUser] = useImmer({\n        name: \"John\",\n        age: 32,\n        address: {\n          country: \"Singapore\",\n          postalCode: 440004,\n        },\n      });\n\n      //Update user details upon any event\n      setUser((draft) => {\n        draft.address.country = \"Germany\";\n      });\n      ```javascript\n\n      The preceding code enables you to update nested objects with a conceise mutation syntax."

That means, same input always returns the same output. These reducers run during rendering time similar to state updater functions. So these functions should not send any requests, schedule time outs and any other side effects.\n\n     2. Each action should describe a single user interaction even though there are multiple changes applied to data. For example, if you \"reset\" registration form which has many user input fields managed by a reducer, it is suggested to send one \"reset\" action instead of creating separate action for each fields. The proper ordering of actions should reflect the user interactions in the browser and it helps a lot for debugging purpose."

    "title": "How does ReactJS work behind the scenes?",
    "answer": "ReactJS is a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. While it appears simple on the surface, React performs a lot of complex operations behind the scenes to efficiently update the UI. Here's an overview of how it works internally:\n\n     #### **1. Virtual DOM & Component Rendering**\n\n     React doesn't manipulate the real DOM directly. Instead, it uses a **Virtual DOM** — a lightweight JavaScript representation of the UI.\n\n     When a component renders (e.g., `<App />`):\n\n        *   React **executes the component function** (e.g., `App()`).\n        *   Hooks like `useState` are registered and tracked in order.\n        *   React builds a **Virtual DOM tree** from the returned JSX.\n        *   This virtual DOM is a **plain JS object** that describes the desired UI.\n\n     This process ensures fast and efficient rendering before React decides how to update the real DOM.\n\n     #### 2. **React Fiber Architecture**\n\n     React’s core engine is called **Fiber**, introduced in React 16. Fiber is a reimplementation of the React reconciliation algorithm with the following capabilities:\n\n        *   Breaks rendering work into **units of work** (fiber nodes).\n        *   Enables **interruptible rendering** (important for responsiveness).\n        *   Supports **priority scheduling** and **concurrent rendering**.\n\n     Each Fiber node represents a component and stores:\n\n        *   The component type (function/class).\n        *   Props, state, and effects.\n        *   Links to parent, child, and sibling fibers.\n\n     #### 3. **Reconciliation (Diffing Algorithm)**\n\n     When state or props change:\n\n        *   React re-executes the component to produce a new virtual DOM.\n        *   It **compares the new virtual DOM to the previous one** using an efficient diffing algorithm.\n        *   React determines the **minimal set of DOM changes** required.\n\n     This process is known as **reconciliation**.\n\n     #### 4. **Commit Phase (Real DOM Updates)**\n\n     Once reconciliation is done:\n\n        *   React enters the **commit phase**.\n        *   It applies calculated changes to the **real DOM**.\n        *   It also runs side effects like `useEffect` or `useLayoutEffect`.\n\n     This is the only time React interacts directly with the browser DOM.\n\n     #### 5. **Hooks and State Management**\n\n     With Hooks (like `useState`, `useEffect`):\n\n        *   React keeps an **internal list of hooks per component**.\n        *   Hooks are identified by their order in the function.\n        *   When state updates occur, React re-renders the component and re-runs the hooks in the same order.\n\n     #### 6. **React Scheduler**\n\n     React uses an internal **Scheduler** to control how updates are prioritized:\n\n        *   Urgent tasks like clicks and inputs are processed immediately.\n        *   Non-urgent tasks (like data fetching) can be delayed or paused.\n        *   This improves responsiveness and allows for **time slicing** in Concurrent Mode."

    "answer": "What are the steps to follow for useContext?\n\nThe `useContext` hook is a built-in React Hook that lets you access the value of a context inside a functional component without needing to wrap it in a <Context.Consumer> component.\n\n     It helps you **avoid prop drilling** (passing props through multiple levels) by allowing components to access shared data like themes, authentication status, or user preferences.\n\n     The usage of useContext involves three main steps:\n      #### **Step 1 : Create the Context**\n    \n        Use `React.createContext()` to create a context object.\n    \n        ```jsx\n        import React, { createContext } from 'react'; \n    \n        const ThemeContext = createContext(); // default value optional\n        ```javascript\n    \n      You typically export this so other components can import it.\n\n      #### **Step 2: Provide the Context Value**\n    \n        Wrap your component tree (or a part of it) with the `Context.Provider` and pass a `value` prop.\n    \n        ```jsx\n        function App() {\n            return ( \n                <ThemeContext.Provider value=\"dark\">\n                   <MyComponent />\n                </ThemeContext.Provider>\n            ); \n        }\n        ```javascript\n    \n        Now any component inside `<ThemeContext.Provider>` can access the context value.\n\n        #### **Step 3: Consume the Context with** `**useContext**`\n    \n        In any functional component **inside the Provider**, use the `useContext` hook:\n    \n        ```jsx\n        import { useContext } from 'react'; \n        function MyComponent() {\n            const theme = useContext(ThemeContext); // theme = \"dark\"\n            return <p>Current Theme: {theme}</p>; \n        }\n        ```"

    "title": "What are the use cases of useContext hook?",
    "answer": "The `useContext` hook in React is used to share data across components without having to pass props manually through each level. Here are some common and effective use cases:\n\n        1.  **Theme Customization**  \n            `useContext` can be used to manage application-wide themes, such as light and dark modes, ensuring consistent styling and enabling user-driven customization.\n        2.  **Localization and Internationalization**  \n            It supports localization by providing translated strings or locale-specific content to components, adapting the application for users in different regions.\n        3.  **User Authentication and Session Management**  \n            `useContext` allows global access to authentication status and user data. This enables conditional rendering of components and helps manage protected routes or user-specific UI elements.\n        4.  **Shared Modal or Sidebar Visibility**  \n            It's ideal for managing the visibility of shared UI components like modals, drawers, or sidebars, especially when their state needs to be controlled from various parts of the app.\n        5.  **Combining with** `**useReducer**` **for Global State Management**  \n            When combined with `useReducer`, `useContext` becomes a powerful tool for managing more complex global state logic. This pattern helps maintain cleaner, scalable state logic without introducing external libraries like Redux.\n             Some of the common use cases of useContext are listed below,"

    "answer": "Next.js provides two different routing systems: the **Page Router** (traditional) and the **App Router** (introduced in Next.js 13). The App Router is built on React Server Components and offers more powerful features for modern web applications.\n\n     Here are the main differences between them:\n\n     | Feature | Page Router | App Router |\n     |---------|-------------|------------|\n     | Directory | Uses `pages/` directory | Uses `app/` directory |\n     | Routing | File-based routing with files like `pages/about.js` | File-based routing with folders and special files like `app/about/page.js` |\n     | Components | All components are Client Components by default | All components are Server Components by default |\n     | Layouts | Custom `_app.js` and `_document.js` for shared layouts | Native nested layouts using `layout.js` files |\n     | Data Fetching | Uses `getServerSideProps`, `getStaticProps`, and `getInitialProps` | Uses `async/await` in Server Components with native `fetch` |\n     | Loading States | Manual implementation required | Built-in `loading.js` for streaming and suspense |\n     | Error Handling | Custom `_error.js` page | Built-in `error.js` for error boundaries at any level |\n     | Streaming | Limited support | Built-in support for streaming with Suspense |\n     | Server Actions | Not available | Native support for server-side mutations |\n     | Metadata | Using `Head` component from `next/head` | Native Metadata API with `metadata` object or `generateMetadata` function |\n     | Rendering | SSR, SSG, ISR, and CSR | SSR, SSG, ISR, CSR plus React Server Components |\n\n     **Example of Page Router structure:**\n     ```javascript\n     pages/\n     ├── index.js          // Home page (/)\n     ├── about.js          // About page (/about)\n     ├── _app.js           // Custom App component\n     ├── _document.js      // Custom Document\n     └── posts/\n         └── [id].js       // Dynamic route (/posts/:id)\n     ```javascript\n\n     **Example of App Router structure:**\n     ```javascript\n     app/\n     ├── page.js           // Home page (/)\n     ├── layout.js         // Root layout\n     ├── loading.js        // Loading UI\n     ├── error.js          // Error UI\n     ├── about/\n     │   └── page.js       // About page (/about)\n     └── posts/\n         └── [id]/\n             └── page.js   // Dynamic route (/posts/:id)\n     ```javascript\n\n     **Note:** The App Router is recommended for new Next.js applications as it provides better performance, simpler data fetching patterns, and improved developer experience with React Server Components."

    "answer": "The `useMemo()` Hook in React is used to **optimize performance** by **memoizing the result of expensive calculations**. It ensures that a function is **only re-executed when its dependencies change**, preventing unnecessary computations on every re-render.\n\n     #### Syntax\n\n     ```js\n      const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(arg), [dependencies]);\n     ```javascript\n      - **`computeExpensiveValue`**:  \n      A function that returns the computed result.\n\n     - **`dependencies`**:  \n      An array of values that, when changed, will cause the memoized function to re-run.\n\n      If the dependencies haven’t changed since the last render, React returns the **cached result** instead of re-running the function.\n\n      Let's exaplain the usage of `useMemo` hook with an example of user search and its respective filtered users list.\n\n      #### Example: Memoizing a Filtered List\n      ```javascript\n      import React, { useState, useMemo } from 'react';\n\n      const users = [\n        { id: 1, name: 'Sudheer' },\n        { id: 2, name: 'Brendon' },\n        { id: 3, name: 'Charlie' },\n        { id: 4, name: 'Dary' },\n        { id: 5, name: 'Eden' }\n      ];\n\n      export default function UserSearch({ users }) {\n        const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState('');\n        const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);\n\n        // Memoize the filtered user list based on the search term\n        const filteredUsers = useMemo(() => {\n          console.log(\"Filtering users...\");\n          return users.filter(user =>\n            user.name.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase())\n          );\n        }, [searchTerm]);\n\n        return (\n          <div>\n            <h2>Counter: {counter}</h2>\n            <button onClick={() => setCounter(prev => prev + 1)}>Increment Counter</button>\n\n            <h2>Search Users</h2>\n            <input\n              type=\"text\"\n              value={searchTerm}\n              onChange={(e) => setSearchTerm(e.target.value)}\n              placeholder=\"Enter name\"\n            />\n\n            <ul>\n              {filteredUsers.map(user => (\n                <li key={user.id}>{user.name}</li>\n              ))}\n            </ul>\n          </div>\n        );\n      }\n      ```javascript\n\n      In the above example:\n        - The filteredUsers list is only recomputed when searchTerm changes.\n        - Pressing the \"Increment Counter\" button does not trigger the filtering logic again, as it's not a dependency.\n        - The console will only log \"Filtering users...\" when the search term updates."

    "title": "What is an updater function?",
    "answer": "Should an updater function be used in all cases?\n\nAn **updater function** is a form of `setState` where you pass a **function** instead of a direct value. This function receives the **previous state** as an argument and returns the **next state**.\n     \n     The updater function expression looks like below,\n     ```js\n     setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1); // Safe and predictable\n     ```javascript\n     Here, `prevCount => prevCount + 1` is the updater function.\n\n     In the React community, there's often a recommendation to use updater functions when updating state that depends on its previous value. This helps prevent unexpected behaviors that can arise from working with outdated or \"stale\" state.\n\n     While using an updater function is a good habit, it's not always necessary. In most cases, React batches updates and ensures that the state is up-to-date at the beginning of the event handler, so you typically don’t run into stale state issues during a single synchronous event.\n     However, if you’re doing multiple updates to the same state variable within a single handler, using the updater form ensures that each update correctly uses the latest state value, rather than a potentially outdated one.\n\n     **Example: Multiple Updates in One Handler**\n     ```js\n     function handleCount() {\n        setCounter(a => a + 1);\n        setCounter(a => a + 1);\n        setCounter(a => a + 1);\n     }\n     ```javascript\n\n     In this example, `a => a + 1` is an **updater function**. React queues these updater functions and applies them sequentially, each using the most recent state value. As a result, the counter will correctly increment by 3.\n\n     In many cases, such as setting state based on user input or assigning static values, you don’t need the updater function:\n     ```js\n     setName('Sudheer');\n     ```"

    "title": "Can useState take a function as an initial value?",
    "answer": "Yes, `useState` can take a function as an initial value, and this is a useful feature in React called **lazy initialization**. This function is also known as **initializer function**.\n\n     When you call useState(initialValue), you normally pass in a value directly:\n     \n     ```js\n     const [count, setCount] = useState(0);  // initial value is 0\n     ```javascript\n\n     But if calculating that initial value is expensive or involves logic, you can pass a function that returns the value:\n     ```js\n        const [count, setCount] = useState(() => {\n        // This function only runs once — when the component first renders\n        return expensiveComputation();\n        });\n     ```javascript\n     \n     This function avoids doing heavy computation on every render. If you don't use this function form and invokes it directly, the function will run everytime the component renders and impact the performance.\n     For example, the below usage is not recommended. \n     ```js\n     const [count, setCount] = useState(expensiveComputation());\n     ```"

    "title": "Is useState Synchronous or Asynchronous?",
    "answer": "The `useState` hook is synchronous, but state updates are asynchronous. When you call `useState()`, it runs synchronously and returns the state variable and setter function as tuple.\n     ```js\n     const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n     ```javascript\n     This happens immediately during rendering.\n     However, the state update function (**setState**) is asynchronous in the sense that it doesn't update the state immediately.\n     React **batches** updates and applies them before the next render. You won’t see the updated value immediately after calling `setState`.\n     \n     **Example:**\n     ```js\n     const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n    \n     function handleClick() {\n       setCount(count + 1);\n       console.log(count); // ❗️Still logs the old value\n     }\n     ```javascript\n     The > `console.log(count)` prints the **old value**, because the update hasn’t happened yet.\n     \n     To see the updated state value, you can use `useEffect()` hook. It runs **after the component has re-rendered.**  By the time `useEffect` runs:\n\n        *   The component has been updated.\n        *   The **state contains the new value**.\n     \n        ```js\n        import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\n\n        function Counter() {\n        const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n        \n        const handleClick = () => {\n        setCount(count + 1);\n        console.log('Clicked count (old):', count); // Old value\n        };\n        \n        useEffect(() => {\n        console.log('Updated count:', count); // New value\n        }, [count]); // Only runs when `count` changes\n        \n        return <button onClick={handleClick}>Count: {count}</button>;\n        }\n        ```"

    "title": "Can you explain how useState works internally?",
    "answer": "React’s hooks, including `useState`, rely on some internal machinery that keeps track of state **per component** and **per hook call** during rendering. Here's a simplified explanation of the internal mechanics:\n\n      #### 1. **Hook List / Linked List**\n\n      *   React maintains a linked list or array of \"hook states\" for each component.\n      *   When a component renders, React keeps track of which hook it is currently processing via a cursor/index.\n      *   Each call to `useState()` corresponds to one \"slot\" in this list.\n\n      #### 2. **State Storage**\n\n      *   Each slot stores:\n        *   The current state value.\n        *   A queue of pending state updates.\n\n      #### 3. **Initial Render**\n        \n      *   When the component first renders, React:\n         *   Creates a new slot for `useState` with the initial state (e.g., `0`).\n         *   Returns `[state, updaterFunction]`.\n\n      #### 4. **Updater Function**\n    \n      *   The updater function (`setCount`) is a closure that, when called:\n        *   Enqueues a state update to React's internal queue.\n        *   Schedules a re-render of the component.\n    \n      #### 5. **Re-render and State Update**\n    \n      *   On the next render:\n        *   React processes all queued updates for each hook slot.\n        *   Updates the stored state value accordingly.\n        *   Returns the new state to the component.\n\n      #### 6. **Important: Hook Order**\n\n      *   Hooks must be called in the same order on every render so React can match hook calls to their internal slots.\n      *   That’s why you can’t call hooks conditionally.\n      \n      The pseudocode for internal implementation of `useState` looks like below,\n      ```js\n        let hookIndex = 0;\n        const hooks = [];\n        \n        function useState(initialValue) {\n            const currentIndex = hookIndex;\n        \n            if (!hooks[currentIndex]) {\n                // First render: initialize state\n                hooks[currentIndex] = {\n                    state: initialValue,\n                    queue: [],\n                };\n            }\n        \n            const hook = hooks[currentIndex];\n        \n            // Process queued updates\n            hook.queue.forEach(update => {\n                hook.state = update(hook.state);\n            });\n            hook.queue = [];\n        \n            // Define updater function\n            function setState(action) {\n                // action can be new state or function(state) => new state\n                hook.queue.push(typeof action === 'function' ? action : () => action);\n                scheduleRender(); // triggers React re-render\n            }\n        \n            hookIndex++;\n            return [hook.state, setState];\n        }\n        ```"

    "title": "How does useContext works?",
    "answer": "Explain with an example\n\nThe `useContext` hook can be used for authentication state management across multiple components and pages in a React application.\n    \n     Let's build a simple authentication flow with:\n\n        *   **Login and Logout buttons**\n        *   Global `AuthContext` to share state\n        *   Components that can **access and update** auth status\n     \n      **1. Create the Auth Context:**\n\n       You can define `AuthProvider` which holds and provides `user`, `login()`, and `logout()` via context.\n        ```js\n        // AuthContext.js\n        import React, { createContext, useContext, useState } from 'react';\n        \n        const AuthContext = createContext();\n        \n        export function AuthProvider({ children }) {\n          const [user, setUser] = useState(null);\n        \n          const login = (username) => setUser({ name: username });\n          const logout = () => setUser(null);\n        \n          return (\n            <AuthContext.Provider value={{ user, login, logout }}>\n              {children}\n            </AuthContext.Provider>\n          );\n        }\n        \n        // Custom hook for cleaner usage\n        export const useAuth = () => useContext(AuthContext);\n        ```javascript\n     **2. Wrap Your App with the Provider:**\n       \n        Wrap the above created provider in main `App.js` file      \n        ```js\n        // App.js\n        import React from 'react';\n        import { AuthProvider } from './AuthContext';\n        import HomePage from './HomePage';\n        import Dashboard from './Dashboard';\n        \n        function App() {\n          return (\n            <AuthProvider>\n              <HomePage />\n              <Dashboard />\n            </AuthProvider>\n          );\n        }\n        \n        export default App;\n        ```javascript\n     **3. Home page with login:**\n      Read or access user and login details through custom useAuth hook and use it inside home page.\n\n        ```js\n         // HomePage.js\n         import React from 'react';\n         import { useAuth } from './AuthContext';\n    \n         function HomePage() {\n           const { user, login } = useAuth();\n    \n           return (\n             <div>\n               <h1>Home</h1>\n               {user ?

    "answer": "A **common pitfall** when using `useContext` with objects is **triggering unnecessary re-renders** across all consuming components — even when only part of the context value changes.\n\n     When you provide an object as the context value, React compares the entire object reference. If the object changes (even slightly), React assumes the whole context has changed, and **all components using** `useContext(MyContext)` **will re-render**, regardless of whether they use the part that changed.\n\n     **Example:**\n     ```js\n        const MyContext = React.createContext();\n\n        function MyProvider({ children }) {\n          const [user, setUser] = useState(null);\n          const [theme, setTheme] = useState('light');\n\n          // This causes all consumers to re-render on any state change\n          const contextValue = { user, setUser, theme, setTheme };\n\n          return (\n            <MyContext.Provider value={contextValue}>\n              {children}\n            </MyContext.Provider>\n          );\n        }\n     ```javascript\n     In this case, a change in `theme` will also trigger a re-render in components that only care about `user`.\n\n     This issue can be fixed in two ways,\n\n     **1. Split Contexts**  \n     Create separate contexts for unrelated pieces of state:\n\n     ```jsx\n     const UserContext = React.createContext(); \n     const ThemeContext = React.createContext();\n     ```javascript\n\n     **2. Memoize Context Value**  \n     Use `useMemo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders:\n\n     ```jsx\n       const contextValue = useMemo(() => ({ user, setUser, theme, setTheme }), [user, theme]);\n     ```javascript\n\n     However, this only helps if the object structure and dependencies are well controlled."

    "answer": "The `useEffect` hook accepts an optional dependencies argument that accepts an array of reactive values. The **dependency array** determines **when** the effect runs. i.e, It makes `useEffect` _reactive_ to changes in specified values.\n\n     #### **How Dependency Array Affects Behavior**\n\n     1. **Empty Dependency Array:** `**[]**`\n\n     ```css\n     useEffect(() => {\n       // runs once after the initial render\n     }, []);\n     ```javascript\n\n      *   Effect runs **only once** (like `componentDidMount`).\n      *   Ignores all state/prop changes.\n\n     2. **With Specific Dependencies:** `**[count, user]**`\n\n     ```css\n     useEffect(() => {\n       // runs after initial render\n       // AND whenever `count` or `user` changes\n     }, [count, user]);\n     ```javascript\n\n       *   Effect runs on **first render**, and\n       *   Again **every time** any dependency value changes.\n\n     3. **No Dependency Array (Omitted)**\n\n          ```css\n          useEffect(() => {\n            // runs after **every** render\n          });\n          ```javascript\n\n           *   Effect runs after **every render**, regardless of what changed.\n           *   Can lead to **performance issues** if not used carefully.\n\n       React uses shallow comparison of the dependencies.

Unlike `useState`, changing `.current` does not cause re-renders, but the value is preserved across renders.\n        \n        **Example:**\n        ```js\n        function Timer() {\n          const renderCount = useRef(0);\n          useEffect(() => {\n            renderCount.current++;\n            console.log(\"Render count:\", renderCount.current);\n          });\n        \n          return <div>Check console for render count.</div>;\n        }\n        ```"

    "answer": "The `useMemo` hook **does not directly prevent re-rendering of child components**. Its main purpose is to memoize the result of an expensive computation so that it doesn’t get recalculated unless its dependencies change. While this can improve performance, it doesn’t inherently control whether a child component re-renders.\n        \n        However, `useMemo` **can help prevent re-renders** when the memoized value is passed as a prop to a child component that is wrapped in `React.memo`. In that case, if the memoized value doesn’t change between renders (i.e., it has the same reference), React.memo can skip re-rendering the child. So, while `useMemo` doesn’t stop renders on its own, it **works in combination** with tools like `React.memo` to optimize rendering behavior."

    "title": "What are Custom React Hooks, and How Can You Develop One?",
    "answer": "**Custom Hooks** in React are JavaScript functions that allow you to **extract and reuse component logic** using React’s built-in Hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, etc.\n\n      They start with the word **\"use\"** and let you encapsulate logic that multiple components might share—such as fetching data, handling forms, or managing timers—without repeating code.\n\n      Let's explain the custom hook usage with `useFetchData` example. The `useFetchData` custom Hook is a reusable function in React that simplifies the process of fetching data from an API. It encapsulates common logic such as initiating the fetch request, managing loading and error states, and storing the fetched data. By using built-in Hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`, `useFetchData` provides a clean interface that returns the `data`, `loading`, and `error` values, which can be directly used in components.\n\n      ```jsx\n      import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\n\n      function useFetchData(url) {\n        const [data, setData] = useState(null);     // Holds the response\n        const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true); // Loading state\n        const [error, setError] = useState(null);     // Error state\n\n        useEffect(() => {\n          let isMounted = true; // Prevent setting state on unmounted component\n          setLoading(true);\n\n          fetch(url)\n            .then((response) => {\n              if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Network response was not ok');\n              return response.json();\n            })\n            .then((json) => {\n              if (isMounted) {\n                setData(json);\n                setLoading(false);\n              }\n            })\n            .catch((err) => {\n              if (isMounted) {\n                setError(err.message);\n                setLoading(false);\n              }\n            });\n\n          return () => {\n            isMounted = false; // Clean-up function to avoid memory leaks\n          };\n        }, [url]);\n\n        return { data, loading, error };\n      }\n      ```javascript\n\n      The above custom hook can be used to retrieve users data for `AuthorList`, `ReviewerList` components.\n\n      **Example: AuthorList component**\n      ```jsx\n      function AuthorList() {\n        const { data, loading, error } = useFetchData('https://api.example.com/authors');\n\n        if (loading) return <p>Loading authors...</p>;\n        if (error) return <p>Error: {error}</p>;\n\n        return (\n          <ul>\n            {data.map((author) => (\n              <li key={author.id}>{author.name}</li>\n            ))}\n          </ul>\n        );\n      }\n      ```javascript\n     \n      Some of the benefits of custom hooks are:\n       *   Promotes **code reuse**\n       *   Keeps components **clean and focused**\n       *   Makes complex logic **easier to test and maintain**"

    "answer": "The `useSyncExternalStore` hook is designed to **subscribe to external stores** (non-React state sources) in a way that's compatible with concurrent rendering. It's primarily used by library authors for state management libraries.\n\n     #### Syntax\n     ```js\n     const state = useSyncExternalStore(subscribe, getSnapshot, getServerSnapshot?);\n     ```javascript\n\n     - **subscribe**: Function to subscribe to the store, returns an unsubscribe function\n     - **getSnapshot**: Function that returns the current store value\n     - **getServerSnapshot**: Optional function for SSR that returns the initial server snapshot\n\n     #### Example: Browser Online Status\n     ```jsx\n     import { useSyncExternalStore } from 'react';\n\n     function getSnapshot() {\n       return navigator.onLine;\n     }\n\n     function subscribe(callback) {\n       window.addEventListener('online', callback);\n       window.addEventListener('offline', callback);\n       return () => {\n         window.removeEventListener('online', callback);\n         window.removeEventListener('offline', callback);\n       };\n     }\n\n     function useOnlineStatus() {\n       return useSyncExternalStore(subscribe, getSnapshot, () => true);\n     }\n\n     function StatusBar() {\n       const isOnline = useOnlineStatus();\n       return <h1>{isOnline ? '✅ Online' : '❌ Disconnected'}</h1>;\n     }\n     ```javascript\n\n     This hook ensures that when the external store changes, React re-renders consistently without tearing (showing inconsistent data)."

    "title": "What is the purpose of callback function as an argument of `setState()`?",
    "answer": "The callback function provided as the second argument to `setState` is executed after the state has been updated and the component has re-rendered. Because `setState()` is asynchronous, you cannot reliably perform actions that require the updated state immediately after calling `setState`. The callback ensures your code runs only after the update and re-render are complete.\n\n    #### Example\n\n    ```jsx\n    this.setState({ name: \"Sudheer\" }, () => {\n      console.log(\"The name has been updated and the component has re-rendered.\");\n    });\n    ```javascript\n\n    #### When to use the callback?\n\n    Use the `setState` callback when you need to perform an action immediately after the DOM has been updated in response to a state change. i.e, The callback is a reliable way to perform actions after a state update and re-render, especially when the timing is critical due to the asynchronous nature of state updates in React. For example, if you need to interact with the updated DOM, trigger analytics, or perform further computations that depend on the new state or rendered output.\n\n    #### Note\n\n    - In modern React (with function components), you can achieve similar effects using the `useEffect` hook to respond to state changes.\n    - In class components, you can also use lifecycle methods like `componentDidUpdate` for broader post-update logic.\n    - The `setState` callback is still useful for one-off actions that directly follow a specific state change."

    "answer": "There are 3 possible ways to achieve this in class components:\n\n   1. **Binding in Constructor:** In JavaScript classes, the methods are not bound by default. The same rule applies for React event handlers defined as class methods. Normally we bind them in constructor.\n\n      ```javascript\n      class User extends Component {\n        constructor(props) {\n          super(props);\n          this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);\n        }\n        handleClick() {\n          console.log(\"SingOut triggered\");\n        }\n        render() {\n          return <button onClick={this.handleClick}>SingOut</button>;\n        }\n      }\n      ```javascript\n\n   2. **Public class fields syntax:** If you don't like to use bind approach then _public class fields syntax_ can be used to correctly bind callbacks. The Create React App enables this syntax by default.\n\n      ```jsx harmony\n      handleClick = () => {\n        console.log(\"SingOut triggered\", this);\n      };\n      ```javascript\n\n      ```jsx harmony\n      <button onClick={this.handleClick}>SingOut</button>\n      ```javascript\n\n   3. **Arrow functions in callbacks:** It is possible to use _arrow functions_ directly in the callbacks.\n\n      ```jsx harmony\n      handleClick() {\n          console.log('SingOut triggered');\n      }\n      render() {\n          return <button onClick={() => this.handleClick()}>SignOut</button>;\n      }\n      ```javascript\n\n   **Note:** If the callback is passed as prop to child components, those components might do an extra re-rendering. In those cases, it is preferred to go with `.bind()` or _public class fields syntax_ approach considering performance."

In order to use _refs_ throughout the component, just assign the _ref_ to the instance property within constructor.\n\n      ```jsx harmony\n      class MyComponent extends React.Component {\n        constructor(props) {\n          super(props);\n          this.myRef = React.createRef();\n        }\n        render() {\n          return <div ref={this.myRef} />;\n        }\n      }\n      ```javascript\n\n   2. You can also use ref callbacks approach regardless of React version. For example, the search bar component's input element is accessed as follows,\n      ```jsx harmony\n      class SearchBar extends Component {\n        constructor(props) {\n          super(props);\n          this.txtSearch = null;\n          this.state = { term: \"\" };\n          this.setInputSearchRef = (e) => {\n            this.txtSearch = e;\n          };\n        }\n        onInputChange(event) {\n          this.setState({ term: this.txtSearch.value });\n        }\n        render() {\n          return (\n            <input\n              value={this.state.term}\n              onChange={this.onInputChange.bind(this)}\n              ref={this.setInputSearchRef}\n            />\n          );\n        }\n      }\n      ```javascript\n\n   You can also use _refs_ in function components using **closures**.\n   **Note**: You can also use inline ref callbacks even though it is not a recommended approach."

    "answer": "It is preferred to use _callback refs_ over `findDOMNode()` API. Because `findDOMNode()` prevents certain improvements in React in the future.\n\n   The **legacy** approach of using `findDOMNode`:\n\n   ```javascript\n   class MyComponent extends Component {\n     componentDidMount() {\n       findDOMNode(this).scrollIntoView();\n     }\n\n     render() {\n       return <div />;\n     }\n   }\n   ```javascript\n\n   The recommended approach is:\n\n   ```javascript\n   class MyComponent extends Component {\n     constructor(props) {\n       super(props);\n       this.node = createRef();\n     }\n     componentDidMount() {\n       this.node.current.scrollIntoView();\n     }\n\n     render() {\n       return <div ref={this.node} />;\n     }\n   }\n   ```"

    "title": "Why are String Refs legacy?",
    "answer": "If you worked with React before, you might be familiar with an older API where the `ref` attribute is a string, like `ref={'textInput'}`, and the DOM node is accessed as `this.refs.textInput`. We advise against it because _string refs have below issues_, and are considered legacy. String refs were **removed in React v16**.\n\n   1. They _force React to keep track of currently executing component_. This is problematic because it makes react module stateful, and thus causes weird errors when react module is duplicated in the bundle.\n   2. They are _not composable_ — if a library puts a ref on the passed child, the user can't put another ref on it. Callback refs are perfectly composable.\n   3. They _don't work with static analysis_ like Flow. Flow can't guess the magic that framework does to make the string ref appear on `this.refs`, as well as its type (which could be different). Callback refs are friendlier to static analysis.\n   4. It doesn't work as most people would expect with the \"render callback\" pattern (e.g. <DataGrid renderRow={this.renderRow} />)\n\n      ```jsx harmony\n      class MyComponent extends Component {\n        renderRow = (index) => {\n          // This won't work. Ref will get attached to DataTable rather than MyComponent:\n          return <input ref={\"input-\" + index} />;\n\n          // This would work though! Callback refs are awesome.\n          return <input ref={(input) => (this[\"input-\" + index] = input)} />;\n        };\n\n        render() {\n          return (\n            <DataTable data={this.props.data} renderRow={this.renderRow} />\n          );\n        }\n      }\n      ```"

    "title": "What are the different phases of component lifecycle?",
    "answer": "The component lifecycle has three distinct lifecycle phases:\n\n    1. **Mounting:** The component is ready to mount in the browser DOM. This phase covers initialization from `constructor()`, `getDerivedStateFromProps()`, `render()`, and `componentDidMount()` lifecycle methods.\n\n    2. **Updating:** In this phase, the component gets updated in two ways, sending the new props and updating the state either from `setState()` or `forceUpdate()`. This phase covers `getDerivedStateFromProps()`, `shouldComponentUpdate()`, `render()`, `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()` and `componentDidUpdate()` lifecycle methods.\n\n    3. **Unmounting:** In this last phase, the component is not needed and gets unmounted from the browser DOM. This phase includes `componentWillUnmount()` lifecycle method.\n\n    It's worth mentioning that React internally has a concept of phases when applying changes to the DOM. They are separated as follows\n\n    4. **Render** The component will render without any side effects. This applies to Pure components and in this phase, React can pause, abort, or restart the render.\n\n    5. **Pre-commit** Before the component actually applies the changes to the DOM, there is a moment that allows React to read from the DOM through the `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()`.\n\n    6. **Commit** React works with the DOM and executes the final lifecycles respectively `componentDidMount()` for mounting, `componentDidUpdate()` for updating, and `componentWillUnmount()` for unmounting.\n\n    React 16.3+ Phases (or an [interactive version](http://projects.wojtekmaj.pl/react-lifecycle-methods-diagram/))\n\n    ![phases 16.4+](images/phases16.4.png)\n\n    Before React 16.3\n\n    ![phases 16.2](images/phases.png)"

    "title": "What are the lifecycle methods of React?",
    "answer": "Before React 16.3\n\n    - **componentWillMount:** Executed before rendering and is used for App level configuration in your root component.\n    - **componentDidMount:** Executed after first rendering and here all AJAX requests, DOM or state updates, and set up event listeners should occur.\n    - **componentWillReceiveProps:** Executed when particular prop updates to trigger state transitions.\n    - **shouldComponentUpdate:** Determines if the component will be updated or not. By default it returns `true`. If you are sure that the component doesn't need to render after state or props are updated, you can return false value. It is a great place to improve performance as it allows you to prevent a re-render if component receives new prop.\n    - **componentWillUpdate:** Executed before re-rendering the component when there are props & state changes confirmed by `shouldComponentUpdate()` which returns true.\n    - **componentDidUpdate:** Mostly it is used to update the DOM in response to prop or state changes.\n    - **componentWillUnmount:** It will be used to cancel any outgoing network requests, or remove all event listeners associated with the component.\n\n    React 16.3+\n\n    - **getDerivedStateFromProps:** Invoked right before calling `render()` and is invoked on _every_ render. This exists for rare use cases where you need a derived state. Worth reading [if you need derived state](https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/06/07/you-probably-dont-need-derived-state.html).\n    - **componentDidMount:** Executed after first rendering and where all AJAX requests, DOM or state updates, and set up event listeners should occur.\n    - **shouldComponentUpdate:** Determines if the component will be updated or not. By default, it returns `true`. If you are sure that the component doesn't need to render after the state or props are updated, you can return a false value. It is a great place to improve performance as it allows you to prevent a re-render if component receives a new prop.\n    - **getSnapshotBeforeUpdate:** Executed right before rendered output is committed to the DOM. Any value returned by this will be passed into `componentDidUpdate()`. This is useful to capture information from the DOM i.e. scroll position.\n    - **componentDidUpdate:** Mostly it is used to update the DOM in response to prop or state changes. This will not fire if `shouldComponentUpdate()` returns `false`.\n    - **componentWillUnmount** It will be used to cancel any outgoing network requests, or remove all event listeners associated with the component."

The solution is to pass a function to `setState()`, with the previous state as an argument. By doing this you can avoid issues with the user getting the old state value on access due to the asynchronous nature of `setState()`.\n\n    Let's say the initial count value is zero. After three consecutive increment operations, the value is going to be incremented only by one.\n\n    ```javascript\n    // assuming this.state.count === 0\n    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });\n    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });\n    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });\n    // this.state.count === 1, not 3\n    ```javascript\n\n    If we pass a function to `setState()`, the count gets incremented correctly.\n\n    ```javascript\n    this.setState((prevState, props) => ({\n      count: prevState.count + props.increment,\n    }));\n    // this.state.count === 3 as expected\n    ```javascript\n\n    **(OR)**"

    "title": "Why function is preferred over object for `setState()`?",
    "answer": "React may batch multiple `setState()` calls into a single update for performance. Because `this.props` and `this.state` may be updated asynchronously, you should not rely on their values for calculating the next state.\n\n    This counter example will fail to update as expected:\n\n    ```javascript\n    // Wrong\n    this.setState({\n      counter: this.state.counter + this.props.increment,\n    });\n    ```javascript\n\n    The preferred approach is to call `setState()` with function rather than object. That function will receive the previous state as the first argument, and the props at the time the update is applied as the second argument.\n\n    ```javascript\n    // Correct\n    this.setState((prevState, props) => ({\n      counter: prevState.counter + props.increment,\n    }));\n    ```"

    "title": "Why is `isMounted()` an anti-pattern and what is the proper solution?",
    "answer": "The primary use case for `isMounted()` is to avoid calling `setState()` after a component has been unmounted, because it will emit a warning.\n\n    ```javascript\n    if (this.isMounted()) {\n      this.setState({...})\n    }\n    ```javascript\n\n    Checking `isMounted()` before calling `setState()` does eliminate the warning, but it also defeats the purpose of the warning. Using `isMounted()` is a code smell because the only reason you would check is because you think you might be holding a reference after the component has unmounted.\n\n    An optimal solution would be to find places where `setState()` might be called after a component has unmounted, and fix them. Such situations most commonly occur due to callbacks, when a component is waiting for some data and gets unmounted before the data arrives. Ideally, any callbacks should be canceled in `componentWillUnmount()`, prior to unmounting."

You can just pass `--typescript` option as below\n\n         ```bash\n         npx create-react-app my-app --typescript\n\n         # or\n\n         yarn create react-app my-app --typescript\n         ```javascript\n\n         Whereas for lower versions of react scripts, just supply `--scripts-version` option as `react-scripts-ts` while you create a new project. `react-scripts-ts` is a set of adjustments to take the standard `create-react-app` project pipeline and bring TypeScript into the mix.\n\n         Now the project layout should look like the following:\n\n         ```javascript\n         my-app/\n         ├─ .gitignore\n         ├─ images.d.ts\n         ├─ node_modules/\n         ├─ public/\n         ├─ src/\n         │  └─ ...\n         ├─ package.json\n         ├─ tsconfig.json\n         ├─ tsconfig.prod.json\n         ├─ tsconfig.test.json\n         └─ tslint.json\n         ```"

    "title": "Why are inline ref callbacks or functions not recommended?",
    "answer": "If the ref callback is defined as an inline function, it will get called twice during updates, first with null and then again with the DOM element. This is because a new instance of the function is created with each render, so React needs to clear the old ref and set up the new one.\n\n    ```jsx\n    class UserForm extends Component {\n      handleSubmit = () => {\n        console.log(\"Input Value is: \", this.input.value);\n      };\n\n      render() {\n        return (\n          <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>\n            <input type=\"text\" ref={(input) => (this.input = input)} /> //\n            Access DOM input in handle submit\n            <button type=\"submit\">Submit</button>\n          </form>\n        );\n      }\n    }\n    ```javascript\n\n    But our expectation is for the ref callback to get called once, when the component mounts. One quick fix is to use the ES7 class property syntax to define the function\n\n    ```jsx\n    class UserForm extends Component {\n      handleSubmit = () => {\n        console.log(\"Input Value is: \", this.input.value);\n      };\n\n      setSearchInput = (input) => {\n        this.input = input;\n      };\n\n      render() {\n        return (\n          <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>\n            <input type=\"text\" ref={this.setSearchInput} /> // Access DOM input\n            in handle submit\n            <button type=\"submit\">Submit</button>\n          </form>\n        );\n      }\n    }\n    ```"

    "answer": "There are two main ways of implementing HOCs in React.\n\n    1.  Props Proxy (PP) and\n    2.  Inheritance Inversion (II).\n\n    But they follow different approaches for manipulating the _WrappedComponent_.\n\n    **Props Proxy**\n\n    In this approach, the render method of the HOC returns a React Element of the type of the WrappedComponent. We also pass through the props that the HOC receives, hence the name **Props Proxy**.\n\n    ```jsx\n    function ppHOC(WrappedComponent) {\n      return class PP extends React.Component {\n        render() {\n          return <WrappedComponent {...this.props} />;\n        }\n      };\n    }\n    ```javascript\n\n    **Inheritance Inversion**\n\n    In this approach, the returned HOC class (Enhancer) extends the WrappedComponent. It is called Inheritance Inversion because instead of the WrappedComponent extending some Enhancer class, it is passively extended by the Enhancer. In this way the relationship between them seems **inverse**.\n\n    ```jsx\n    function iiHOC(WrappedComponent) {\n      return class Enhancer extends WrappedComponent {\n        render() {\n          return super.render();\n        }\n      };\n    }\n    ```"

    "answer": "Error boundaries do not catch errors inside event handlers.\n\n    React doesn’t need error boundaries to recover from errors in event handlers. Unlike the render method and lifecycle methods, the event handlers don’t happen during rendering. So if they throw, React still knows what to display on the screen.\n\n    If you need to catch an error inside an event handler, use the regular JavaScript try / catch statement:\n\n    ```javascript\n    class MyComponent extends React.Component {\n      constructor(props) {\n        super(props);\n        this.state = { error: null };\n        this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);\n      }\n\n      handleClick() {\n        try {\n          // Do something that could throw\n        } catch (error) {\n          this.setState({ error });\n        }\n      }\n\n      render() {\n        if (this.state.error) {\n          return <h1>Caught an error.</h1>;\n        }\n        return <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Click Me</button>;\n      }\n    }\n    ```javascript\n\n    Note that the above example is demonstrating regular JavaScript behavior and doesn’t use error boundaries."

    "title": "What are the limitations with HOCs?",
    "answer": "Higher-order components come with a few caveats apart from its benefits. Below are the few listed in an order,\n\n    1.  **Don’t use HOCs inside the render method:**\n        It is not recommended to apply a HOC to a component within the render method of a component.\n\n        ```javascript\n        render() {\n          // A new version of EnhancedComponent is created on every render\n          // EnhancedComponent1 !== EnhancedComponent2\n          const EnhancedComponent = enhance(MyComponent);\n          // That causes the entire subtree to unmount/remount each time!\n          return <EnhancedComponent />;\n        }\n        ```javascript\n\n        The above code impacts on performance by remounting a component that causes the state of that component and all of its children to be lost. Instead, apply HOCs outside the component definition so that the resulting component is created only once.\n\n    2.  **Static methods must be copied over:**\n        When you apply a HOC to a component the new component does not have any of the static methods of the original component\n\n        ```javascript\n        // Define a static method\n        WrappedComponent.staticMethod = function () {\n          /*...*/\n        };\n        // Now apply a HOC\n        const EnhancedComponent = enhance(WrappedComponent);\n\n        // The enhanced component has no static method\n        typeof EnhancedComponent.staticMethod === \"undefined\"; // true\n        ```javascript\n\n        You can overcome this by copying the methods onto the container before returning it,\n\n        ```javascript\n        function enhance(WrappedComponent) {\n          class Enhance extends React.Component {\n            /*...*/\n          }\n          // Must know exactly which method(s) to copy :(\n          Enhance.staticMethod = WrappedComponent.staticMethod;\n          return Enhance;\n        }\n        ```javascript\n\n    3.  **Refs aren’t passed through:**\n        For HOCs you need to pass through all props to the wrapped component but this does not work for refs. This is because ref is not really a prop similar to key. In this case you need to use the React.forwardRef API"

This way it can conditionally render component.\n\n    ```javascript\n    function Greeting(props) {\n      if (!props.loggedIn) {\n        return null;\n      }\n\n      return <div className=\"greeting\">welcome, {props.name}</div>;\n    }\n    ```javascript\n\n    ```javascript\n    class User extends React.Component {\n      constructor(props) {\n        super(props);\n        this.state = {loggedIn: false, name: 'John'};\n      }\n\n      render() {\n       return (\n           <div>\n             //Prevent component render if it is not loggedIn\n             <Greeting loggedIn={this.state.loggedIn} />\n             <UserDetails name={this.state.name}>\n           </div>\n       );\n      }\n    ```javascript\n\n    In the above example, the `greeting` component skips its rendering section by applying condition and returning null value."

    "title": "Give an example on How to use context?",
    "answer": "**Context** is designed to share data that can be considered **global** for a tree of React components.\n\n    For example, in the code below lets manually thread through a “theme” prop in order to style the Button component.\n\n    ```javascript\n    //Lets create a context with a default theme value \"luna\"\n    const ThemeContext = React.createContext(\"luna\");\n    // Create App component where it uses provider to pass theme value in the tree\n    class App extends React.Component {\n      render() {\n        return (\n          <ThemeContext.Provider value=\"nova\">\n            <Toolbar />\n          </ThemeContext.Provider>\n        );\n      }\n    }\n    // A middle component where you don't need to pass theme prop anymore\n    function Toolbar(props) {\n      return (\n        <div>\n          <ThemedButton />\n        </div>\n      );\n    }\n    // Lets read theme value in the button component to use\n    class ThemedButton extends React.Component {\n      static contextType = ThemeContext;\n      render() {\n        return <Button theme={this.context} />;\n      }\n    }\n    ```"

    "title": "How do you use contextType?",
    "answer": "ContextType is used to consume the context object. The contextType property can be used in two ways,\n\n    1.  **contextType as property of class:**\n        The contextType property on a class can be assigned a Context object created by React.createContext(). After that, you can consume the nearest current value of that Context type using this.context in any of the lifecycle methods and render function.\n\n        Lets assign contextType property on MyClass as below,\n\n        ```javascript\n        class MyClass extends React.Component {\n          componentDidMount() {\n            let value = this.context;\n            /* perform a side-effect at mount using the value of MyContext */\n          }\n          componentDidUpdate() {\n            let value = this.context;\n            /* ... */\n          }\n          componentWillUnmount() {\n            let value = this.context;\n            /* ... */\n          }\n          render() {\n            let value = this.context;\n            /* render something based on the value of MyContext */\n          }\n        }\n        MyClass.contextType = MyContext;\n        ```javascript\n\n    2.  **Static field**\n        You can use a static class field to initialize your contextType using public class field syntax.\n\n        ```javascript\n        class MyClass extends React.Component {\n          static contextType = MyContext;\n          render() {\n            let value = this.context;\n            /* render something based on the value */\n          }\n        }\n        ```"

    "answer": "Refs will not get passed through because ref is not a prop. It is handled differently by React just like **key**. If you add a ref to a HOC, the ref will refer to the outermost container component, not the wrapped component. In this case, you can use Forward Ref API. For example, we can explicitly forward refs to the inner FancyButton component using the React.forwardRef API.\n\n    The below HOC logs all props,\n\n    ```javascript\n    function logProps(Component) {\n      class LogProps extends React.Component {\n        componentDidUpdate(prevProps) {\n          console.log(\"old props:\", prevProps);\n          console.log(\"new props:\", this.props);\n        }\n\n        render() {\n          const { forwardedRef, ...rest } = this.props;\n\n          // Assign the custom prop \"forwardedRef\" as a ref\n          return <Component ref={forwardedRef} {...rest} />;\n        }\n      }\n\n      return React.forwardRef((props, ref) => {\n        return <LogProps {...props} forwardedRef={ref} />;\n      });\n    }\n    ```javascript\n\n    Let's use this HOC to log all props that get passed to our “fancy button” component,\n\n    ```javascript\n    class FancyButton extends React.Component {\n      focus() {\n        // ...\n      }\n\n      // ...\n    }\n    export default logProps(FancyButton);\n    ```javascript\n\n    Now let's create a ref and pass it to FancyButton component. In this case, you can set focus to button element.\n\n    ```javascript\n    import FancyButton from \"./FancyButton\";\n\n    const ref = React.createRef();\n    ref.current.focus();\n    <FancyButton label=\"Click Me\" handleClick={handleClick} ref={ref} />;\n    ```"

    "answer": "`State mutation` happens when you try to update the state of a component without actually using `setState` function. This can happen when you are trying to do some computations using a state variable and unknowingly save the result in the same state variable. This is the main reason why it is advised to return new instances of state variables from the reducers by using Object.assign({}, ...) or spread syntax.\n\n    This can cause unknown issues in the UI as the value of the state variable got updated without telling React to check what all components were being affected from this update and it can cause UI bugs.\n\n    Ex:\n\n    ```javascript\n    class A extends React.component {\n      constructor(props) {\n        super(props);\n        this.state = {\n          loading: false\n        }\n     }\n\n    componentDidMount() {\n      let { loading } = this.state;\n      loading = (() => true)(); // Trying to perform an operation and directly saving in a state variable\n    }\n\n    ```javascript\n\n    **How to prevent it:** Make sure your state variables are immutable by either enforcing immutability by using plugins like Immutable.js, always using `setState` to make updates, and returning new instances in reducers when sending updated state values."

    "title": "How does JVM works",
    "answer": "JVM(Java Virtual Machine) is an abstract runtime engine to run java applications. It is part of Java Runtime Environment(JRE) to execute the bytecode generated by java compilers. JVM brings WORA(Write Once Read Anywhere) behavior in which you can write java program on one system and expected to run on any java enabled systems without any modifications. Upon compiling .java file to .class file(contains byte code), .class file goes into several steps described by JVM.\n\n   JVM consists of three main components:\n\n   1. Class Loader subsystem\n   2. Runtime data area/ memory area\n   3. Execution engine\n\n   Let's understand the JVM architecture which includes the above three components,\n\n   \n\n   1. **Class Loader Subsystem:** The class loaders are responsible to load the class files dynamically into JVM during the runtime. The first class that loaded into the memory is usually the class that contains `main` method.This subsystem performs three main activities.\n\n      1. **Loading:** As part of this step, the class loader will read the .class file and generate the corresponding bytecode. The following important information of the class file will be saved in method area of JVM.\n\n         1. The Fully Qualified Class Name(FQCN) of the loaded class.\n         2. Immediate parent class.\n         3. Variables, method and modifier information\n         4. Whether .class is related to Class, Interface or Enum.\n\n         JVM also creates an object of **Class** type(available from **java.lang** package) to represent the file in the heap memory. But it will be created only on the very first time when the class file is loaded into JVM. This object is helpful for the developers to get class level information.\n\n      2. **Linking:** Linking is the process of taking a class or interface and combining it into the runtime state of the Java virtual machine, preparing it for execution. It involves the following steps:\n\n         1. **Verification:** This phase ensure the correctness of `.class` file by checking whether the file is properly formatted or not, and the code generated by a valid compiler or not. If the validation is failed, you will receive `java.lang.VerifyError` through **ByteCodeVerifier**.\n\n         2. **Preparation:** In this step, JVM allocates memory for all static variables within classes/interfaces and assign them with default values.\n\n         3. **Resolution:** In this step, all symbolic references to classes or interfaces are replaced with their actual memory locations. This transformation is known as **Dynamic Linking**.\n\n      3. **Initialization:** This is the last phase of class loading, where all static variables are replaced with their original values and static block gets executed.\n\n   There are three built-in classloaders available in Java:\n\n   1. **Bootstrap ClassLoader:** This is a root class loader and typically represented as null. It loads the core java libraries located in <JAVA_HOME>/jmods folder like `java.lang`, `java.util` etc. This class loader is written in native code unlike other class loaders.\n\n   2. **Platform ClassLoader:** This class loader is responsible for loading platform classes such as Java SE platform APIs, their implementation classes and JDK-specific run-time classes. For example, the platform classes such as `java.net.http`, `java.sql`, `org.graalvm.compile`(JDK Specific).\n\n   3. **System/Application classLoader:** This class loader is responsible for loading all the classes configured from the classpath. The classpath can contain classes from directories, JAR files etc.\n\n   The above class loaders follows a class loader hierarchy ensuring a delegation mechanism. That means, if the class is loaded and its not found by application classloader, the request is delegated upwards to the platform application class loader. But even it is not found by platform class loader then further delegate upwards to Bootstrap class loader.\n\n   **Note:** Apart from the above built-in class loaders, you can also create your own user defined class loader for ensuring application independence. For example, Tomcat webserver use this approach(WebAppClassLoader) to ensure that different web applications to load and isolate classes/jars.\n\n   2. **Runtime data area/ memory area:**\n\n      The runtime data areas are mainly divided into five components,\n\n      1. **Method:** The method area stores below class level information,\n\n         1. ClassLoader reference\n         2. Runtime constant pool\n         3. Field data such as name, type, modifiers, attributes etc of each field.\n         4. Method data such as name, return type, modifiers, attributes, parameter types etc of each field.\n         5. Constructor data such as parameter types and their order for each constructor.\n\n      This is a shared resource and only one method area is available per JVM.\n\n      2. **Heap:** This is the runtime data area in which all the objects and their respective instance variables are stored. The heap is created upon JVM startup and there is only one heap per JVM.\n\n      3. **Stack:** Each thread which is created in JVM, a separate runtime-stack is also created at the same time. The local variables, method calls and intermediate results are stored in this stack area. But if the thread requires a larger stack size than what is available, JVM throws `StackOverflow` error.\n\n      For each method call, a stack frame is created in the stack memory area and it is going to be destroyed upon method execution gets completed. Each stack frame is further divided into three sections.\n\n      1. **Local variables:** For each frame, all the local variables and their values are stored in an array format.\n      2. **Operand stack:** In each frame, the variables and operators required for mathematical operations are stored in LIFO stack.\n      3. **Frame data:** This area holds all symbolic references related to constant pool resolution and method returned data. It is also used to store a reference to the exception table which has all the information related to catch block in case of exceptions.\n\n      **Note:** Stack area is not a shared resource.\n\n      4. **PC Registers:** JVM supports multiple threads at the same time and each thread has separate PC registers. These registers are used to store address of the currently executed JVM instruction. After completion of current instruction, PC register is going to be updated with next instruction.\n\n      5. **Native method stack:** This stack is used to hold the information related to native methods written in C, C++ and Assembly.\n\n   3. **Execution engine:** The execution engine is responsible for executing the bytecode that is loaded into the JVM. It communicates with various runtime data memories of JVM during the execution. Once the program is finished executing, the memory in the runtime data area will be released.\n\n      It contains three main components for executing the class files.\n\n      1. **Interpreter:** The interpreter reads and executes the bytecode instructions line by line to convert into respective machine language instructions. The main advantage of interpreter is that it is very quick to load and execute the code in a faster pace. But whenever it executes the same code blocks again and again, the interpreter executes repeatedly. So the interpreter cannot be optimized the runtime in case of repeated code execution.\n\n      2. **JIT compiler:** Just-In-Time Compiler(JIT Compiler) is introduced to overcome the disadvantages of interpreter, especially with repeated code execution. JIT compiler can remember the repeated code block segments and they will stored as native code in the cache. Whenever JIT compiler reads the same code block again, it will use the native code stored in the cache.\n\n      JIT compiler has further divided into the following components,\n\n      1. **Intermediate Code Generator:** It generates intermediate code.\n      2. **Code Optimizer:** It optimizes the intermediate code for better performance.\n      3. **Target Code Generator:** It converts intermediate code into native machine code.\n      4. **Profiler:** This is used to identify Hotspots(i.e, repeatedly executing methods) and replace hotspots with respective native code.\n\n      5. **Garbage Collector:** Garbage Collector(GC) is responsible to collect and remove unreferenced objects from the heap area. This memory management feature is used to reclaim the unused memory and makes free space for newer objects. This happens in two phases:\n\n         1. **Mark:** In this step, GC identifies the unused objects in memory\n         2. **Sweep:** As part of this step, GC removes the objects identified in the previous phase.\n\n   4. **Java Native Interface (JNI) :** JNI is used as a bridge between java method calls and native libraries written in C, C++ etc. Sometimes it is required to invoke native code for specific underlined hardeware.\n   5. **Native Method Libraries :** These are collection of native libraries(C/C++/Assembly) which are required by execution engine. These libraries loaded through JNI and represented in the form of `.dll` or `.so` files.",

    "title": "What are the main features of Java",
    "answer": "Java has many important features which makes it unique among the popular programming languages. Some of those features are:\n\n   1. **Simple:** Java is a simple programming language and easy to understand without any complexities unlike in the prior programming languages.\n      Some of the reasons for simplicity are: 1. It is based on C++ which makes it easy for new developers to learn it quickly. 2. Java doens't support pointers(unlike C or C++) considering its complexity and security vulnerabilities. Also, operator overloading doesn't exist in Java. 3. There is no need to remove unreferenced objects because it will be taken care by Automatic Garbage Collection.\n\n   2. **Object-oriented:** Java is an Object Oriented programming(OOPS) language, which means everything in Java is represented with different types of classes and objects. This OOPS is a methodology that simplifies software development and maintenance by following the below features.\n\n      1. Abstraction\n      2. Encapsulation\n      3. Inheritance\n      4. Polymorphism\n\n   3. **Portable:** Java is portable because the bytecode generated on one machine can be taken to any platform for the execution.\n\n   4. **Platform Independent:** The java compiler converts the source code to bytecode and then JVM executes the bytecode to produce the output. If you compile a java program on specific operating system(let's say Windows), it can run on any other platform(Windows, Linux or Mac) with that platform specific JVM. This is the reason why we call Java as a platform-independent language.\n\n   5. **Robust:** Java is robust with many safe guards to ensure reliable code. It has the below safe guards,\n\n      1. It is capable of handling unexpected termination of a program through exception handling feature.\n      2. It provides strong memory management through Garbage Collector from JVM, which collects all the unused variables and objects to free up the memory space. Whereas in prior programming languages, programmers are solely responsible for allocating and deallocating memory spaces.\n\n   6. **Secured:** Java is extremely safe due to various features listed below,\n\n      1. There are no explicit pointers. So you cannot access out-of-bound array. If you still try to access an array, it will show an `ArrayIndexOutOfBound` Exception. So it is impossible to exploit in Java with security flaws like stack corruption or buffer overflow.\n      2. The programs runs in an secured environment(JVM) that is independent of operating system(OS).\n      3. Java has bytecode verifier that checks the code blocks for any illegal code that violates the access right to objects.\n\n   7. **Distributed:** Java supports the creation of distributed applications by using Remote Method Invocation(RMI) and Enterprise Java Beans. The java programs are easily distributed on one or more systems through internet connection.\n\n   8. **Multi-threaded:** Java supports multithreading feature, which allows concurrent execution of several parts of a program for maximum utilization of the CPU. This is possible through multiple threads running the program simultaneously.\n\n   9. **Compiled and Interpreted:** It provides both compilation and interpretation of programs. The programs are compiled by compiler first and the generated bytecode is going to be interpreted.\n\n   10. **High performance:** Java bytecode is close to native code, so it runs more quickly than other conventionally interpreted programming languages. Ofcourse, it is not as fast as compiled languages like C or C++. JVM also uses JIT compiler which enables high performance through below features.\n   11. Method inlining\n   12. Dead code elimination\n   13. Null check elimination\n   14. Constant folding"

    "title": "What is public static void main?",
    "answer": "The `main()` method acts as a starting point for JVM to start the execution of a Java program. i.e, JVM doesn't execute the code if there is no main method in the code. The signature of main method should follow specific pattern for the JVM to recognize it as a entry point. Since it is an important method of Java, you need to have proper understanding of its signature in detail.\n\n   The signature of main method for displaying \"Hello World\" looks like below,\n\n   ```java\n   public static void main(String[] args) {\n        System.out.println(\"Hello World\");\n   }\n   ```java\n\n   When `java.exe` parses the command line, it generates a new String array and invokes the main() method. Let's describe each word in the statement,\n\n   1. Public: The public access modifier is accessible everywhere and it enables JVM can invoke it from outside the class as it is not present in the current class. Otherwise, you will receive an error saying \"Main method not found in class\".\n\n   2. Static: This static keyword is used to make `main()` method as a class related method so that JVM can invoke it without instantiating the class. It is also helpful to avoid unnecessary memory usage with object just for calling main method.\n\n   3. Void: The void keyword is used to specify that a method doesn’t return anything. Since main() method doesn't return anything, its return type is void. Once the main method terminates, the java program terminates as well.\n\n   4. Main: The \"main\" method name is an identifier that the JVM looks for as the starting point of the Java program.\n\n   5. String[] args: This is an array of strings which stores arguments passed by command line while starting a program.\n\n   **Note:** You can create any number of main methods through overloading features. i.e, Multiple main methods can be created with different parameters."

    "answer": "String constant pool is a special storage space inside the heap memory area where string literals are stored. It is also known as **String pool** or **String Intern Pool**. This is privately maintained by String class and it is empty by default. Whenever you create a new string object, JVM checks for presence of string object in the string pool. If the string value is already present, the same object reference is shared with the variable, else a new string is created in the pool with the variable reference stored in stack area."

    "answer": "Strings are immutable, that means the contents of string objects can't be modified after their creation. i.e, When you try to alter the string, it creates a new string. Due to this behavior, the internal state of a string remains the same throughout the execution of the program. This characteristic of immutability helps with the benefits of caching, security, synchronization, and performance."

    "title": "What is the importance of hashCode() and equals() methods",
    "answer": "Since both `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods are available in Object class(i.e, Java.lang.object), every java class gets the default implementation of equals and hashCode methods. These methods work together to verify if two objects have the same value or not.\n\n   **1. equals:** The `equals()` method is used to compare equality of two Objects. By default their implementation compares the identities of the object. The Object class defined `equals()` method as follows,\n\n   ```java\n   public boolean equals(Object obj) {\n       return (this == obj);\n   }\n   ```java\n\n   There are some rules need to be followed to use equals method:\n\n   1. **Reflexive:** For any object x, `x.equals(x)` should return `true`.\n   2. **Symmetric:** For any two objects x and y, `x.equals(y)` should return `true` if and only if `y.equals(x)` returns `true`.\n   3. **Transitive:** For multiple objects x, y, and z, `if x.equals(y)` returns `true` and `y.equals(z)` returns `true`, then `x.equals(z)` should return `true`.\n   4. **Consistent:** For any two objects x and y, multiple invocations of `x.equals(y)` should return same result(`true` or `false`), unless any of the object properties is modified that is being used in the equals() method implementation.\n\n   **2. hashCode:** The `hashCode()` method returns the integer hash code value of the object. This method must be overridden in every class which overrides `equals()` method. The general contract of hashCode is:\n\n   1. While execution of the application, the multiple invocations of `hashCode()` on the object should return the same integer value, unless the object property used in the `equals()` method is being modified.\n   2. During the multiple executions of the application, the object's hashCode can change.\n   3. If two objects are equal based on `equals()` method, then their object's hash code must be same.\n   4. If two objects are unequal based on `equals()` method, their hash code value may or may not be equal.\n\n   Together, the implementation of `equals()` and `hashCode()` should follow these rules.\n\n   1. If `x.equals(y)` is true, then `x.hashCode() === y.hashCode()` should always be true.\n   2. If `x.hashCode() === y.hashCode()` is true, then it doesn't required to be `x.equals(y)` always true."

    "answer": "An exception is an event that interrupts the normal flow the program execution. There are two types of exceptions,\n\n    1. Checked exceptions\n    2. Unchecked exceptions\n\n    The hierarchical structure of exceptions is categorized as shown below,\n\n    \n\n    The exceptions which are checked at compile time are known as checked exceptions. If some code inside a method throws this checked exception, then either you need to handle(or caught) the exception using **try/catch** block or declare in the method signature using **thows** keyword.\n\n    Some of the common checked exceptions are,\n\n    1. IOException\n    2. FileNotFoundException\n    3. ClassNotFoundException\n    4. InterruptedException\n    5. SQLException\n    6. ParseException\n\n    For example, the following class has two methods which throws checked(`FileNotFoundException`) exceptions from FileInputStream constructor. This is due to accessing input file which doesn't exist. You can handle them either using try/catch block or declaring thows keyword in the method signature.\n\n    ```java\n        import java.io.*;\n\n        class MyCheckedExceptions {\n\n            private void methodWithTryCatch() {\n                    File file = new File(\"non_existing_file.txt\");\n                    try {\n                        FileInputStream stream = new FileInputStream(file);\n                    } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {\n                        e.printStackTrace();\n                    }\n            }\n\n            private void methodWithThrows() throws FileNotFoundException {\n                    File file = new File(\"non_existing_file.txt\");\n                    FileInputStream stream = new FileInputStream(file);\n            }\n\n        }\n    ```java\n\n    Whereas the exceptions which are not checked at compile time are known as unchecked exceptions. All the exceptions under Error and RuntimeException comes under unchecked exceptions.\n\n    Some of the common unchecked exceptions are,\n\n    1. NullPointerException\n    2. ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException\n    3. ArithmeticException\n    4. NumberFormatException\n    5. IllegalThreadStateException\n\n    For example, the following method doesn't have any errors during compile time. But it will throw `ArithmeticException` during runtime because of division by zero.\n\n    ```java\n    class MyUncheckedException {\n\n        private void divideByZero() {\n    \t    int a = 1;\n    \t    int b = 0;\n    \t    int result = a / b;\n        }\n\n    }\n    ```",

    "title": "What are wrapper classes",
    "answer": "Wrapper classes provides the mechanism to convert primitive types into object types and vice versa. Since Java is an object-oriented programming language, and many APIs and libraries in Java require objects instead primitive types. For example, data structures in collection framework, utility classes from `java.utils.*`,cloning process, Serialization, Synchronization etc require object type.\n\n    The following table represent primitives and their respective wrapper classes.\n\n    | Primitive data type | Wrapper class |\n    | ------------------- | ------------- |\n    | byte                | Byte          |\n    | short               | Short         |\n    | int                 | Integer       |\n    | float               | Float         |\n    | double              | Double        |\n    | long                | Long          |\n    | boolean             | Boolean       |\n    | char                | Character     |\n\n    You can use `.valueOf` methods from wrapper classes to convert primitive to object type, and the same way wrapper class methods like `intValue`, `doubleValue` etc used to convert wrapper class to primitive type. But this manual process can be automated.\n\n    1. **autoboxing**\n\n    The automatic conversion of primitive to object(corresponding wrapper class) is known as **autoboxing**. The following example demonstrate how the conversion works,\n\n    ```java\n    public class AutoboxingDemo{\n        public static void main(String args[]){\n            int num = 10;\n            Integer x = Integer.valueOf(num); // Converting primitive int into Integer explicitly\n            Integer y = num; // Autoboxing without explicit conversion\n\n            System.out.println(\"x = \"+ x + \" y \" + y);\n        }\n    }\n    ```java\n\n    2. **unboxing**\n       The automatic conversion of wrapper class to primitive is known as **unboxing**. The following example demonstrate both manual and automatic conversion,\n\n    ```java\n    public class UnboxingDemo{\n       public static void main(String args[]){\n           Integer num = new Integer(3);\n           int x = num.intValue(); //Converting Integer to int explicitly\n           int y = num; //Unboxing without manual conversion\n\n           System.out.println(\"x =\"+ x + \"y = \"+y);\n       }\n    }\n    ```java\n\n    **Note:** These autoboxing and unboxing features are available from JDK1.5 version onwards."

It supports primitive data types like int, byte, long, short, etc., which are not objects. Even though you can convert primitive data types to objects using wrapper classes, it does not make Java a pure object-oriented language. Because these objects are not originally associated with Java and internally it uses operations like Unboxing and Autoboxing. That means even you use wrapper classes, under the hood it uses primitive types for the calculation.\n\n    2. Both static variables and methods can be accessed without using an object. Instead, they are associated with classes, which is against to the object-oriented principle where everything should be an object."

    "answer": "Marker interfaces are interfaces that don't have any fields, methods, or constants inside of it. They are also known as empty interfaces or tag interfaces. Examples of marker interface are Serializable, Cloneable and Remote interface. The purpose of marker interfaces are to provide run-time type information about an object to JVM and Compiler. They are mainly used in API development and in frameworks like Spring to provide additional information to the class.\n\n    Some of the commonly used built-in marker interfaces are:\n\n    1. **Cloneable:** It is available in `java.lang` package. If we try to clone an object that doesn’t implement this marker interface, the JVM throws a `CloneNotSupportedException`. i.e, This marker interface is used as a signal/indicator to the JVM that it is legal to call the `Object.clone()` method.\n    2. **Serializable:** It is available in `java.io` package. When we try to write an object to output stream using `ObjectOutputStream.writeObject()` method without implementing this marker interface, JVM throws an exception named `NotSerializableException`.\n    3. **Remote:** It is available in `java.rmi` package. A remote object can be accessed from another machine if and only if the class has implemented this marker interface. Otherwise, it is going to throw exception named `RemoteException`.\n\n    For example, the cloneable marker interface looks like below,\n\n    ```java\n    public interface Cloneable {\n       // nothing here\n    }\n    ```java\n\n    and the following student class implements Cloneable interface to make a copy of student's object.\n\n    ```java\n    import java.lang.*;\n\n    class Student implements cloneable {\n\n        String name = null;\n        int age = 0;\n\n        Student(String name, int age) {\n            this.name = name;\n            this.age = age;\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        protected Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {\n            return super.clone();\n        }\n\n        public static void main(String[] args) {\n\n            Student s1 = new Student(\"Sudheer\", 30);\n            //Create clone of s1 object\n            try {\n                Student s2 = s1.clone();\n            } catch (Exception e) {\n                System.out.println(s2.toString());\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    ```java\n\n    There are also alternatives for marker interfaces.\n\n    1. **Internal flags:** They can be used in place of marker interface to indicate any specific operation.\n    2. **Annotations:** They are used as tags to represent the metadata attached to classes, interfaces, or methods to indicate additional information required by JVM."

    "title": "What is finalize method?",
    "answer": "How do you override it?\n\nThe `finalize()` is a method from the Object class used to perform cleanup activity before destroying any object. The method is invoked by garbage collector for cleanup activities like closing the resources associated with an object(database connection or network connection). This process is known as **finalization** and it helps JVM for in-memory optimization.\n\n    It is a protected method of Object class with syntax as shown below,\n\n    ```java\n    protected void finalize() throws Throwable{}\n    ```java\n\n    Since Object is the superclass of all java classes, the finalize method is available for every java class. That's why garbage collector can call the `finalize()` method on any java object.\n\n    This method has empty implementation inside Object class. If your class has clean-up activities, you need to override this method. The following example demonstrate how to override the finalize method and call the method explicitly.\n\n    ```java\n    import java.lang.*;\n\n    public class finalizeDemo {\n\n        protected void finalize() throws Throwable {\n                try {\n\n                    System.out.println(\"Inside finalize() method of finalizeDemo class\");\n                }\n                catch (Throwable e) {\n\n                    throw e;\n                }\n                finally {\n\n                    System.out.println(\"Calling finalize method of the Object(super) class\");\n\n                    super.finalize();\n                }\n        }\n\n        public static void main(String[] args) throws Throwable {\n            finalizeDemo fd = new finalizeDemo();\n            fd.finalize();\n        }\n    }\n    ```java\n\n    The statement `super.finalize()` is called inside finally block to ensure its execution even in the case of exceptions.\n\n    **Note:** The garbage collector invokes the `finalize()` method only once on any object."

    "title": "What Is the Difference Between the Comparable and Comparator Interfaces",
    "answer": "Java provides Comparable and Comparator interfaces for sorting the collection of objects, but they serve different purposes and are used in different scenarios. \n\n    **Comparable:**\n    The Comparable interface is capable of comparing an object with another object of same type. The class which needs to compare its instances has to implement `java.lang.Comparable` interface.\n    It can be used to provide **single way of sorting**. That means that the objects can be sorted based on a single data member. For example, Employee object can be sorted based on single attributes like id, name, age etc.\n\n    If the class implements Comparable interface, it knows how to sort the objects because the same class itself has implemented compareTo method. This type of sorting is called **default or natural sorting**. The class can compare its object by overriding compareTo method with syntax as shown below,\n\n    ```java\n    class T implements Comparable<T> {\n        @Override\n        public int compareTo(T t) {\n            // comparison logic goes here\n        }\n    }\n    ```java\n\n    For example, group of employees sorted based on their name attribute using Comparable interfaces as follows\n\n    ```java\n    import java.util.*;\n\n    class Employee implements Comparable<Employee> {\n        private final String id;\n        private final String name;\n        private final int age;\n        \n        public Employee(String id, String name, int age) {\n            this.id = id;\n            this.name = name;\n            this.age = age;\n        }\n        \n        @Override\n        public int compareTo(final Employee employee) {\n            return this.name.compareTo(employee.name);\n        }\n        \n        public String getId() { return this.id; }\n        \n        public String getName() { return this.name; }\n        \n        public int getAge() { return this.age; }\n        \n        @Override\n        public String toString() {\n            return String.format(\"ID: %s | Name: %s | Age: %d\", id, name, age);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public class Main {\n        public static void main(String[] args) {\n            List<Employee> employees = new ArrayList<>();\n\n            employees.add(new Employee(\"3\", \"John\", 32));\n            employees.add(new Employee(\"1\", \"James\", 27));\n            employees.add(new Employee(\"2\", \"Jackson\", 22));\n            \n            Collections.sort(employees);\n\n            employees.forEach(employee -> \n                                System.out.println(employee.toString()));\n        }\n    }\n    ```java\n\n    **Comparator:**\n\n    The comparator is a functional interface used to sort objects and it provides **multiple sorting sequence** in which objects sorted based on multiple data members. This interface is available as part of `java.util` package.  For example, Employee object can be sorted based on multiple attributes like id, name, age etc.\n\n    The comparator is used for custom ordering where the class is not aware about the sorting logic. The comparator can be created using a lambda expression that accept two objects of given type and return an integer value(i.e, 1, 0, -1) based on ordering with syntax as shown below,\n\n    ```java\n     Comparator<T> comparator = (T t1, T t2) -> { \n        //comparison logic \n     }\n    ```java\n\n    You can create multiple separate classes (which implement Comparator interface) to compare by different members.The Comparator provides the compare() method which can be overridden to customize the comparison logic. For example, group of employees sorted based on id and age data members even though Employee class overridden the compareTo method.\n\n    ```java\n    public static void sortById(List<Employee> employees) {\n        Comparator<Employee> idComparator = (Employee e1, Employee e2) -> {\n            return e1.getId().compareTo(e2.getId());\n        };\n        \n        employees.sort(idComparator);\n    }\n    \n    public static void sortByAge(List<Employee> employees) {\n        Comparator<Employee> ageComparator = (Employee e1, Employee e2) -> {\n            return e1.getAge() - e2.getAge();\n        };\n        \n        employees.sort(ageComparator);\n    }\n    ```java\n\n    In the above example, idComparator and ageComparator have been created to perform custom sorting. These comparators needs to be passed as an argument to sort method.\n    \n    **Note:** It is preferred to use lambda expression to create Comparator because it is a functional interface(exactly one abstract method)."

    "answer": "An inner class is a class that is defined within another class. Inner classes are used to logically group classes that are only used in one place, increase encapsulation, and make code more readable and maintainable. Java supports four types of inner classes:\n\n   1. **Member Inner Class (Non-static nested class):** A class defined inside another class without the static modifier. It has access to all members of the outer class, including private members.\n\n   ```java\n   class Outer {\n       private int data = 30;\n       \n       class Inner {\n           void display() {\n               System.out.println(\"Data: \" + data);\n           }\n       }\n       \n       public static void main(String[] args) {\n           Outer outer = new Outer();\n           Outer.Inner inner = outer.new Inner();\n           inner.display();\n       }\n   }\n   ```java\n\n   2. **Static Nested Class:** A static class defined inside another class. It can only access static members of the outer class.\n\n   ```java\n   class Outer {\n       static int data = 30;\n       \n       static class StaticNested {\n           void display() {\n               System.out.println(\"Data: \" + data);\n           }\n       }\n       \n       public static void main(String[] args) {\n           Outer.StaticNested nested = new Outer.StaticNested();\n           nested.display();\n       }\n   }\n   ```java\n\n   3. **Local Inner Class:** A class defined within a method. It can access local variables that are final or effectively final.\n\n   ```java\n   class Outer {\n       void display() {\n           final int num = 23;\n           \n           class LocalInner {\n               void print() {\n                   System.out.println(\"Number: \" + num);\n               }\n           }\n           \n           LocalInner inner = new LocalInner();\n           inner.print();\n       }\n   }\n   ```java\n\n   4. **Anonymous Inner Class:** A class without a name, used to instantiate objects with certain extras such as overriding methods.\n\n   ```java\n   abstract class Animal {\n       abstract void sound();\n   }\n   \n   class Test {\n       public static void main(String[] args) {\n           Animal dog = new Animal() {\n               void sound() {\n                   System.out.println(\"Bark\");\n               }\n           };\n           dog.sound();\n       }\n   }\n   ```"

    "answer": "Java Reflection API is a powerful feature that allows programs to examine and modify the behavior of classes, interfaces, methods, and fields at runtime. It is part of the `java.lang.reflect` package.\n\n    **Key capabilities of Reflection:**\n    1. Examine class properties at runtime\n    2. Create objects dynamically\n    3. Invoke methods at runtime\n    4. Access and modify private fields\n    5. Get information about constructors, methods, and fields\n\n    ```java\n    import java.lang.reflect.*;\n\n    class Person {\n        private String name;\n        public int age;\n        \n        public Person() {}\n        \n        public Person(String name, int age) {\n            this.name = name;\n            this.age = age;\n        }\n        \n        private void privateMethod() {\n            System.out.println(\"Private method called\");\n        }\n        \n        public void display() {\n            System.out.println(\"Name: \" + name + \", Age: \" + age);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public class ReflectionDemo {\n        public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {\n            // Get Class object\n            Class<?> clazz = Person.class;\n            \n            // Get class name\n            System.out.println(\"Class: \" + clazz.getName());\n            \n            // Get all declared methods\n            Method[] methods = clazz.getDeclaredMethods();\n            for (Method method : methods) {\n                System.out.println(\"Method: \" + method.getName());\n            }\n            \n            // Create instance dynamically\n            Constructor<?> constructor = clazz.getConstructor(String.class, int.class);\n            Person person = (Person) constructor.newInstance(\"John\", 25);\n            \n            // Access private field\n            Field nameField = clazz.getDeclaredField(\"name\");\n            nameField.setAccessible(true);\n            nameField.set(person, \"Jane\");\n            \n            // Invoke method\n            Method displayMethod = clazz.getMethod(\"display\");\n            displayMethod.invoke(person);\n        }\n    }\n    ```java\n\n    **Use cases:** Frameworks like Spring, Hibernate, JUnit use Reflection extensively for dependency injection, ORM mapping, and test execution."

    "title": "What is synchronization in Java?",
    "answer": "Synchronization is a mechanism that ensures only one thread can access a shared resource at a time. It prevents race conditions and ensures thread safety.\n\n    **Types of Synchronization:**\n\n    **1. Synchronized Method:**\n    ```java\n    class Counter {\n        private int count = 0;\n        \n        public synchronized void increment() {\n            count++;\n        }\n        \n        public synchronized int getCount() {\n            return count;\n        }\n    }\n    ```java\n\n    **2. Synchronized Block:**\n    ```java\n    class Counter {\n        private int count = 0;\n        private final Object lock = new Object();\n        \n        public void increment() {\n            synchronized (lock) {\n                count++;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    ```java\n\n    **3. Static Synchronization:**\n    ```java\n    class StaticCounter {\n        private static int count = 0;\n        \n        public static synchronized void increment() {\n            count++;\n        }\n    }\n    ```java\n\n    **Example demonstrating the need for synchronization:**\n    ```java\n    class BankAccount {\n        private int balance = 1000;\n        \n        // Without synchronization - race condition possible\n        public void withdraw(int amount) {\n            if (balance >= amount) {\n                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + \" is withdrawing\");\n                balance -= amount;\n                System.out.println(\"Balance after withdrawal: \" + balance);\n            }\n        }\n        \n        // With synchronization - thread safe\n        public synchronized void safeWithdraw(int amount) {\n            if (balance >= amount) {\n                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + \" is withdrawing\");\n                balance -= amount;\n                System.out.println(\"Balance after withdrawal: \" + balance);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    ```java\n\n    **Key Points:**\n    - Every object in Java has an intrinsic lock (monitor)\n    - Only one thread can hold the lock at a time\n    - Synchronization can cause performance overhead\n    - Prefer synchronized blocks over synchronized methods for fine-grained control"

    "answer": "A deadlock is a situation where two or more threads are blocked forever, each waiting for the other to release a lock.\n\n    **Deadlock Example:**\n    ```java\n    public class DeadlockExample {\n        private static final Object lock1 = new Object();\n        private static final Object lock2 = new Object();\n        \n        public static void main(String[] args) {\n            Thread thread1 = new Thread(() -> {\n                synchronized (lock1) {\n                    System.out.println(\"Thread 1: Holding lock1\");\n                    try { Thread.sleep(100); } catch (InterruptedException e) {}\n                    \n                    synchronized (lock2) {\n                        System.out.println(\"Thread 1: Holding lock1 and lock2\");\n                    }\n                }\n            });\n            \n            Thread thread2 = new Thread(() -> {\n                synchronized (lock2) {\n                    System.out.println(\"Thread 2: Holding lock2\");\n                    try { Thread.sleep(100); } catch (InterruptedException e) {}\n                    \n                    synchronized (lock1) {\n                        System.out.println(\"Thread 2: Holding lock2 and lock1\");\n                    }\n                }\n            });\n            \n            thread1.start();\n            thread2.start();\n        }\n    }\n    ```java\n\n    **How to Avoid Deadlock:**\n\n    **1. Lock Ordering - Always acquire locks in the same order:**\n    ```java\n    // Fixed version - both threads acquire locks in same order\n    Thread thread1 = new Thread(() -> {\n        synchronized (lock1) {\n            synchronized (lock2) {\n                // work\n            }\n        }\n    });\n\n    Thread thread2 = new Thread(() -> {\n        synchronized (lock1) {  // Same order as thread1\n            synchronized (lock2) {\n                // work\n            }\n        }\n    });\n    ```java\n\n    **2. Use tryLock with timeout:**\n    ```java\n    import java.util.concurrent.locks.*;\n\n    ReentrantLock lock1 = new ReentrantLock();\n    ReentrantLock lock2 = new ReentrantLock();\n\n    public void safeMethod() {\n        boolean gotLock1 = false;\n        boolean gotLock2 = false;\n        try {\n            gotLock1 = lock1.tryLock(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS);\n            gotLock2 = lock2.tryLock(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS);\n            if (gotLock1 && gotLock2) {\n                // Do work\n            }\n        } catch (InterruptedException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        } finally {\n            if (gotLock1) lock1.unlock();\n            if (gotLock2) lock2.unlock();\n        }\n    }\n    ```java\n\n    **3.

    "answer": "The `volatile` keyword in Java is used to indicate that a variable's value may be modified by different threads. It ensures visibility of changes across threads and prevents caching of the variable.\n\n    **Key Features:**\n    1. **Visibility:** Changes made by one thread are immediately visible to other threads\n    2. **Atomicity:** Read and write operations on volatile variables are atomic (for primitives)\n    3. **No Caching:** The variable is always read from main memory, not from CPU cache\n\n    ```java\n    public class VolatileExample {\n        private volatile boolean running = true;\n        \n        public void stop() {\n            running = false;\n        }\n        \n        public void run() {\n            while (running) {\n                // Do work\n            }\n            System.out.println(\"Stopped\");\n        }\n        \n        public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {\n            VolatileExample example = new VolatileExample();\n            \n            Thread worker = new Thread(() -> example.run());\n            worker.start();\n            \n            Thread.sleep(1000);\n            example.stop(); // This change will be visible to the worker thread\n        }\n    }\n    ```java\n\n    **Without volatile:**\n    ```java\n    // Without volatile, the worker thread might never see the change\n    // because it may read from its local cache\n    private boolean running = true; // Thread may cache this value\n    ```java\n\n    **Volatile vs Synchronized:**\n    | volatile | synchronized |\n    |----------|--------------|\n    | Only ensures visibility | Ensures visibility and atomicity |\n    | No blocking | Causes blocking |\n    | Cannot be used for compound operations | Can protect compound operations |\n    | Less overhead | More overhead |\n\n    **Note:** Volatile is not suitable for compound operations like `count++`. Use `AtomicInteger` or `synchronized` for such cases."

    "title": "What is the diamond problem in Java?",
    "answer": "The diamond problem is an ambiguity that arises in multiple inheritance when a class inherits from two classes that both inherit from a common superclass. It's called \"diamond\" because of the shape of the inheritance diagram.\n\n    **The Problem:**\n    ```java\n           A\n          / \\\n         B   C\n          \\ /\n           D\n    ```java\n    If class D inherits from both B and C, and both B and C override a method from A, which version should D use?\n\n    **Java's Solution:**\n    Java does not allow multiple inheritance with classes to avoid the diamond problem. However, with Java 8+ interfaces having default methods, a similar situation can occur:\n\n    ```java\n    interface A {\n        default void display() {\n            System.out.println(\"Display from A\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    interface B extends A {\n        @Override\n        default void display() {\n            System.out.println(\"Display from B\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    interface C extends A {\n        @Override\n        default void display() {\n            System.out.println(\"Display from C\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Diamond problem with interfaces\n    class D implements B, C {\n        // Must override to resolve ambiguity\n        @Override\n        public void display() {\n            // Can choose which interface method to call\n            B.super.display();  // Calls B's display\n            // or\n            // C.super.display();  // Calls C's display\n            // or provide own implementation\n            System.out.println(\"Display from D\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    public class DiamondProblem {\n        public static void main(String[] args) {\n            D d = new D();\n            d.display();\n        }\n    }\n    ```java\n\n    **Resolution Rules in Java:**\n    1. **Class wins over interface:** If a class inherits a method from both a superclass and an interface, the class method takes precedence\n    2. **Subtype wins:** More specific interface's default method is chosen over less specific one\n    3. **Explicit resolution:** If still ambiguous, the class must explicitly override and specify which method to use\n\n    ```java\n    class Parent {\n        void show() {\n            System.out.println(\"Parent show\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    interface MyInterface {\n        default void show() {\n            System.out.println(\"Interface show\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Class method wins over interface default method\n    class Child extends Parent implements MyInterface {\n        // No override needed - Parent's show() is used automatically\n    }\n    ```"

Easier maintenance and flexibility\n\n    **Types of Dependency Injection:**\n\n    1. **Constructor Injection:**\n    ```java\n    // Dependency\n    interface MessageService {\n        void sendMessage(String message);\n    }\n\n    class EmailService implements MessageService {\n        @Override\n        public void sendMessage(String message) {\n            System.out.println(\"Email sent: \" + message);\n        }\n    }\n\n    class SMSService implements MessageService {\n        @Override\n        public void sendMessage(String message) {\n            System.out.println(\"SMS sent: \" + message);\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Constructor Injection\n    class NotificationService {\n        private final MessageService messageService;\n        \n        // Dependency injected through constructor\n        public NotificationService(MessageService messageService) {\n            this.messageService = messageService;\n        }\n        \n        public void notify(String message) {\n            messageService.sendMessage(message);\n        }\n    }\n    ```java\n\n    2. **Setter Injection:**\n    ```java\n    class NotificationService {\n        private MessageService messageService;\n        \n        // Dependency injected through setter\n        public void setMessageService(MessageService messageService) {\n            this.messageService = messageService;\n        }\n        \n        public void notify(String message) {\n            messageService.sendMessage(message);\n        }\n    }\n    ```java\n\n    3. **Interface Injection:**\n    ```java\n    interface MessageServiceInjector {\n        void injectMessageService(MessageService service);\n    }\n\n    class NotificationService implements MessageServiceInjector {\n        private MessageService messageService;\n        \n        @Override\n        public void injectMessageService(MessageService service) {\n            this.messageService = service;\n        }\n        \n        public void notify(String message) {\n            messageService.sendMessage(message);\n        }\n    }\n    ```java\n\n    **Usage Example:**\n    ```java\n    public class DIExample {\n        public static void main(String[] args) {\n            // Create dependencies\n            MessageService emailService = new EmailService();\n            MessageService smsService = new SMSService();\n            \n            // Inject dependencies\n            NotificationService notifier1 = new NotificationService(emailService);\n            notifier1.notify(\"Hello via Email!\");\n            \n            NotificationService notifier2 = new NotificationService(smsService);\n            notifier2.notify(\"Hello via SMS!\");\n        }\n    }\n    ```java\n\n    **Note:** Frameworks like Spring provide automatic dependency injection using annotations like `@Autowired`, `@Inject`."

    "answer": "Java provides several garbage collector implementations, each optimized for different scenarios:\n\n    **1. Serial Garbage Collector (-XX:+UseSerialGC)**\n    - Uses single thread for garbage collection\n    - Best for single-threaded applications\n    - Causes \"stop-the-world\" pauses\n    - Suitable for small applications with small heaps\n\n    **2. Parallel Garbage Collector (-XX:+UseParallelGC)**\n    - Uses multiple threads for garbage collection\n    - Also known as \"throughput collector\"\n    - Default GC in Java 8\n    - Good for multi-threaded applications requiring high throughput\n\n    **3. G1 Garbage Collector (-XX:+UseG1GC)**\n    - Divides heap into regions\n    - Designed for large heaps (> 4GB)\n    - Default GC from Java 9 onwards\n    - Balances throughput and latency\n    - Predictable pause times\n\n    **4. Z Garbage Collector (-XX:+UseZGC)**\n    - Introduced in Java 11\n    - Ultra-low latency (< 10ms pause times)\n    - Handles heaps from 8MB to 16TB\n    - Concurrent garbage collection\n\n    **5. Shenandoah Garbage Collector (-XX:+UseShenandoahGC)**\n    - Low pause time garbage collector\n    - Performs concurrent compaction\n    - Available in OpenJDK\n\n    ```java\n    public class GCDemo {\n        public static void main(String[] args) {\n            // Check current garbage collector\n            java.lang.management.GarbageCollectorMXBean gc;\n            for (java.lang.management.GarbageCollectorMXBean bean : \n                    java.lang.management.ManagementFactory.getGarbageCollectorMXBeans()) {\n                System.out.println(\"GC Name: \" + bean.getName());\n                System.out.println(\"Collection Count: \" + bean.getCollectionCount());\n                System.out.println(\"Collection Time: \" + bean.getCollectionTime() + \"ms\");\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    ```java\n\n    **JVM Options for GC:**\n    ```bash\n    # Serial GC\n    java -XX:+UseSerialGC -jar app.jar\n\n    # Parallel GC\n    java -XX:+UseParallelGC -XX:ParallelGCThreads=4 -jar app.jar\n\n    # G1 GC\n    java -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=200 -jar app.jar\n\n    # ZGC\n    java -XX:+UseZGC -jar app.jar\n    ```java\n\n    | GC Type | Best For | Pause Time | Throughput |\n    |---------|----------|------------|------------|\n    | Serial | Small apps | High | Low |\n    | Parallel | Throughput apps | Medium | High |\n    | G1 | Large heaps | Low-Medium | Medium-High |\n    | ZGC | Low latency | Very Low | Medium |"

    "title": "What is type erasure in Java generics?",
    "answer": "Type erasure is the process by which the Java compiler removes all generic type information during compilation. Generic type parameters are replaced with their bounds or Object, and type casts are inserted where necessary.\n\n    **How Type Erasure Works:**\n\n    ```java\n    // Before compilation (source code)\n    public class Box<T> {\n        private T content;\n        \n        public void set(T content) {\n            this.content = content;\n        }\n        \n        public T get() {\n            return content;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // After type erasure (bytecode equivalent)\n    public class Box {\n        private Object content;\n        \n        public void set(Object content) {\n            this.content = content;\n        }\n        \n        public Object get() {\n            return content;\n        }\n    }\n    ```java\n\n    **Bounded Type Erasure:**\n    ```java\n    // Before erasure\n    public class NumberBox<T extends Number> {\n        private T number;\n        \n        public double getValue() {\n            return number.doubleValue();\n        }\n    }\n\n    // After erasure - T replaced with Number (its bound)\n    public class NumberBox {\n        private Number number;\n        \n        public double getValue() {\n            return number.doubleValue();\n        }\n    }\n    ```java\n\n    **Bridge Methods:**\n    The compiler generates bridge methods to preserve polymorphism:\n\n    ```java\n    class Node<T> {\n        public T data;\n        \n        public void setData(T data) {\n            this.data = data;\n        }\n    }\n\n    class IntegerNode extends Node<Integer> {\n        @Override\n        public void setData(Integer data) {\n            System.out.println(\"IntegerNode.setData\");\n            super.setData(data);\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Compiler generates bridge method:\n    // public void setData(Object data) {\n    //     setData((Integer) data);  // Calls the actual method\n    // }\n    ```java\n\n    **Implications of Type Erasure:**\n\n    ```java\n    public class TypeErasureDemo {\n        public static void main(String[] args) {\n            // 1. Cannot create instances of type parameters\n            // T obj = new T();  // Compile error\n            \n            // 2. Cannot create arrays of parameterized types\n            // List<String>[] array = new List<String>[10];  // Compile error\n            List<?>[] array = new List<?>[10];  // OK with wildcard\n            \n            // 3. Cannot use instanceof with parameterized types\n            List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();\n            // if (list instanceof ArrayList<String>) {}  // Compile error\n            if (list instanceof ArrayList<?>) {}  // OK with wildcard\n            \n            // 4. Runtime type is same regardless of type parameter\n            List<String> stringList = new ArrayList<>();\n            List<Integer> intList = new ArrayList<>();\n            System.out.println(stringList.getClass() == intList.getClass());  // true\n            \n            // 5. Cannot overload methods that have same erasure\n            // void process(List<String> list) {}\n            // void process(List<Integer> list) {}  // Compile error - same erasure\n        }\n        \n        // Workaround: Use Class<T> for runtime type information\n        public static <T> T createInstance(Class<T> clazz) throws Exception {\n            return clazz.getDeclaredConstructor().newInstance();\n        }\n    }\n    ```java\n\n    **Why Type Erasure?**\n    - Backward compatibility with pre-generics code\n    - No need for new bytecode instructions\n    - Reduced memory footprint (no runtime type info)\n\n    **Limitations:**\n    - Cannot determine generic type at runtime\n    - Cannot create generic arrays\n    - Cannot use primitives as type parameters\n    - Cannot catch or throw generic exceptions\n\n    \n\n\n<!-- QUESTIONS_END -->"

    "answer": "Spring Boot's `hibernate.ddl-auto` (create/update) is good for development but dangerous for production as it can delete data or cause schema drift. Tools like **Flyway** or **Liquibase** provide version control for your database schema.

    "title": "### What are the possible ways to create objects in JavaScript",
    "answer": "There are many ways to create objects in javascript as mentioned below:\n\n    1. **Object literal syntax:**\n\n       The object literal syntax (or object initializer), is a comma-separated set of name-value pairs wrapped in curly braces.\n\n       ```javascript\n       var object = {\n         name: \"Sudheer\",\n         age: 34,\n       };\n       ```javascript\n\n       Object literal property values can be of any data type, including array, function, and nested object.\n\n       **Note:** This is one of the easiest ways to create an object and it's most commonly used for creating simple, ad-hoc objects.\n\n    2. **Object constructor:**\n\n       The simplest way to create an empty object is using the `Object` constructor. Currently this approach is not recommended.\n\n       ```javascript\n       var object = new Object();\n       ```javascript\n\n       The `Object()` is a built-in constructor function so \"new\" keyword is not required for creating plain objects. The above code snippet can be re-written as:\n\n       ```javascript\n       var object = Object();\n       ```javascript\n       However, `Object()` can be used to either create a plain object or convert a given value into its corresponding object wrapper, whereas `new Object()` is specifically used to explicitly create a new object instance.\n       \n    3. **Object's create method:**\n\n       The `create` method of Object is used to create a new object by passing the specified prototype object and properties as arguments, i.e., this pattern is helpful to create new objects based on existing objects. In other words, this is useful for setting up **prototypal inheritance**. The second argument is optional and it is used to create properties on a newly created object.\n\n       The following code creates a new empty object whose prototype is null.\n\n       ```javascript\n       var object = Object.create(null);\n       ```javascript\n\n       The following example creates an object along with additional new properties.\n\n       ```javascript\n       let vehicle = {\n         wheels: \"4\",\n         fuelType: \"Gasoline\",\n         color: \"Green\",\n       };\n       let carProps = {\n         type: {\n           value: \"Volkswagen\",\n         },\n         model: {\n           value: \"Golf\",\n         },\n       };\n\n       var car = Object.create(vehicle, carProps);\n       console.log(car);\n       ```javascript\n\n    4. **Function constructor:**\n\n       In this approach, create any function and apply the new operator to create object instances. This was the main way to do constructor-based OOP before ES6 classes.\n\n       ```javascript\n       function Person(name) {\n         this.name = name;\n         this.age = 21;\n       }\n       var object = new Person(\"Sudheer\");\n       ```javascript\n    5. **Function constructor with prototype:**\n\n       This is similar to function constructor but it uses prototype for their properties and methods. Using prototype means you're sharing methods/properties across instances, which saves memory and improve performance.\n\n       ```javascript\n       function Person() {}\n       Person.prototype.name = \"Sudheer\";\n       var object = new Person();\n       ```javascript\n\n       This is equivalent to creating an instance with `Object.create` method with a function prototype and then calling that function with an instance and parameters as arguments.\n\n       ```javascript\n       function func(x, y, z) {\n        this.x = x;\n        this.y = y;\n        this.z = z;\n       }\n\n       var instance = new func(1, 2, 3);\n       ```javascript\n\n       **(OR)**\n\n       ```javascript\n       function func(x, y, z) {\n          this.x = x;\n          this.y = y;\n          this.z = z;\n       }\n       // Create a new instance using function prototype.\n       var newInstance = Object.create(func.prototype);\n\n       // Call the function\n       var result = func.call(newInstance, 1, 2, 3);\n\n       // If the result is a non-null object then use it otherwise just use the new instance.\n       console.log(result && typeof result === 'object' ? result : newInstance);\n       ```javascript\n\n    6. **Object's assign method:**\n\n       The `Object.assign` method is used to copy all the properties from one or more source objects and stores them into a target object. This is mainly used for cloning and merging\n\n       The following code creates a new staff object by copying properties of his working company and the car he owns.\n\n       ```javascript\n       const orgObject = { company: \"XYZ Corp\" };\n       const carObject = { name: \"Toyota\" };\n       const staff = Object.assign({}, orgObject, carObject);\n       ```javascript\n\n    7. **ES6 Class syntax:**\n\n       ES6 introduces class feature to create objects. This is syntactic sugar over the prototype-based system.\n\n       ```javascript\n       class Person {\n         constructor(name) {\n           this.name = name;\n         }\n       }\n\n       var object = new Person(\"Sudheer\");\n       ```javascript\n\n    8. **Singleton pattern:**\n\n       A Singleton is an object which can only be instantiated one time. Repeated calls to its constructor return the same instance. This way one can ensure that they don't accidentally create multiple instances.\n\n        ##### Singleton with Closure (Classic JS Pattern)\n        ```javascript\n        const Singleton = (function () {\n        let instance;\n\n        function createInstance() {\n          return { name: \"Sudheer\" };\n        }\n\n        return {\n          getInstance: function () {\n            if (!instance) {\n              instance = createInstance();\n            }\n            return instance;\n          }\n        };\n        })();\n\n        // Usage\n        const obj1 = Singleton.getInstance();\n        const obj2 = Singleton.getInstance();\n\n        console.log(obj1 === obj2); // true\n        ```javascript\n         In modern JavaScript applications, singletons are commonly implemented using ES6 modules for their built-in caching behavior, or closures for encapsulated state management."

    "title": "### What is a prototype chain",
    "answer": "The prototype chain is a core concept in JavaScript’s inheritance model. It allows objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects. When you try to access a property or method on an object, JavaScript first looks for it on that object itself. If it’s not found, the engine looks up the object's internal `[[Prototype]]` reference (accessible via `Object.getPrototypeOf(obj)` or the deprecated `__proto__` property) and continues searching up the chain until it finds the property or reaches the end (usually `null`).\n\n    For objects created via constructor functions, the prototype chain starts with the instance, then refers to the constructor’s `.prototype` object, and continues from there. For example:\n\n    ```javascript\n    function Person() {}\n    const person1 = new Person();\n\n    console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(person1) === Person.prototype); // true\n    ```javascript\n\n    This mechanism allows for property and method sharing among objects, enabling code reuse and a form of inheritance.\n\n    **Summary:**\n\n    *   The prototype chain enables inheritance in JavaScript.\n    *   If a property isn’t found on an object, JavaScript looks up its prototype chain.\n    *   The prototype of an object instance can be accessed with `Object.getPrototypeOf(obj)` or `__proto__`.\n    *   The prototype of a constructor function is available via `Constructor.prototype`.\n    *   The chain ends when the prototype is `null`.\n\n    The prototype chain among objects appears as below, \n    \n    ![Screenshot](images/prototype_chain.png)"

    "title": "### What is the Difference Between `call`, `apply`, and `bind`",
    "answer": "In JavaScript, `call`, `apply`, and `bind` are methods that allow you to control the context (`this` value) in which a function is executed. While their purposes are similar, they differ in how they handle arguments and when the function is invoked.\n\n\n  #### `call`\n\n  - **Description:**  \n    The `call()` method invokes a function immediately, allowing you to specify the value of `this` and pass arguments individually (comma-separated).\n\n  - **Syntax:**  \n    ```js\n    func.call(thisArg, arg1, arg2, ...)\n    ```javascript\n\n  - **Example:**\n    ```js\n    var employee1 = { firstName: \"John\", lastName: \"Rodson\" };\n    var employee2 = { firstName: \"Jimmy\", lastName: \"Baily\" };\n\n    function invite(greeting1, greeting2) {\n      console.log(\n        greeting1 + \" \" + this.firstName + \" \" + this.lastName + \", \" + greeting2\n      );\n    }\n\n    invite.call(employee1, \"Hello\", \"How are you?\"); // Hello John Rodson, How are you?\n    invite.call(employee2, \"Hello\", \"How are you?\"); // Hello Jimmy Baily, How are you?\n    ```javascript\n\n\n  #### `apply`\n\n  - **Description:**  \n    The `apply()` method is similar to `call()`, but it takes the function arguments as an array (or array-like object) instead of individual arguments.\n\n  - **Syntax:**  \n    ```js\n    func.apply(thisArg, [argsArray])\n    ```javascript\n\n  - **Example:**\n    ```js\n    var employee1 = { firstName: \"John\", lastName: \"Rodson\" };\n    var employee2 = { firstName: \"Jimmy\", lastName: \"Baily\" };\n\n    function invite(greeting1, greeting2) {\n      console.log(\n        greeting1 + \" \" + this.firstName + \" \" + this.lastName + \", \" + greeting2\n      );\n    }\n\n    invite.apply(employee1, [\"Hello\", \"How are you?\"]); // Hello John Rodson, How are you?\n    invite.apply(employee2, [\"Hello\", \"How are you?\"]); // Hello Jimmy Baily, How are you?\n    ```javascript\n\n\n  #### `bind`\n\n  - **Description:**  \n    The `bind()` method creates a new function with a specific `this` value and, optionally, preset initial arguments. Unlike `call` and `apply`, `bind` does **not** immediately invoke the function; instead, it returns a new function that you can call later.\n\n  - **Syntax:**  \n    ```js\n    var boundFunc = func.bind(thisArg[, arg1[, arg2[, ...]]])\n    ```javascript\n\n  - **Example:**\n    ```js\n    var employee1 = { firstName: \"John\", lastName: \"Rodson\" };\n    var employee2 = { firstName: \"Jimmy\", lastName: \"Baily\" };\n\n    function invite(greeting1, greeting2) {\n      console.log(\n        greeting1 + \" \" + this.firstName + \" \" + this.lastName + \", \" + greeting2\n      );\n    }\n\n    var inviteEmployee1 = invite.bind(employee1);\n    var inviteEmployee2 = invite.bind(employee2);\n\n    inviteEmployee1(\"Hello\", \"How are you?\"); // Hello John Rodson, How are you?\n    inviteEmployee2(\"Hello\", \"How are you?\"); // Hello Jimmy Baily, How are you?\n    ```javascript\n\n\n  #### Summary\n\n  | Method | Invokes Function Immediately? | How Arguments Are Passed         | Returns      |\n  |--------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------|\n  | `call` | Yes                           | Comma-separated list             | Function's result |\n  | `apply`| Yes                           | Array or array-like object       | Function's result |\n  | `bind` | No                            | (Optional) preset, then rest     | New function      |\n\n\n  ## Key Points\n\n  - **`call`** and **`apply`** are almost interchangeable; both invoke the function immediately, but differ in how arguments are passed.\n      - _Tip:_ \"Call is for Comma-separated, Apply is for Array.\"\n  - **`bind`** does not execute the function immediately. Instead, it creates a new function with the specified `this` value and optional arguments, which can be called later.\n\n  - Use `call` or `apply` when you want to immediately invoke a function with a specific `this` context. Use `bind` when you want to create a new function with a specific `this` context to be invoked later."

    "answer": "JavaScript provides two types of equality operators:\n\n    - **Loose equality (`==`, `!=`)**: Performs type conversion if the types differ, comparing values after converting them to a common type.\n    - **Strict equality (`===`, `!==`)**: Compares both value and type, without any type conversion.\n\n    #### Strict Equality (`===`)\n    - Two strings are strictly equal if they have exactly the same sequence of characters and length.\n    - Two numbers are strictly equal if they have the same numeric value.\n      - **Special cases:**\n        - `NaN === NaN` is `false`\n        - `+0 === -0` is `true`\n    - Two booleans are strictly equal if both are `true` or both are `false`.\n    - Two objects are strictly equal if they refer to the **same object** in memory.\n    - `null` and `undefined` are **not** strictly equal.\n\n    #### Loose Equality (`==`)\n    - Converts operands to the same type before making the comparison.\n    - `null == undefined` is `true`.\n    - `\"1\" == 1` is `true` because the string is converted to a number.\n    - `0 == false` is `true` because `false` is converted to `0`.\n\n    #### Examples:\n\n    ```javascript\n    0 == false            // true      (loose equality, type coercion)\n    0 === false           // false     (strict equality, different types)\n    1 == \"1\"              // true      (string converted to number)\n    1 === \"1\"             // false     (different types)\n    null == undefined     // true      (special case)\n    null === undefined    // false     (different types)\n    '0' == false          // true      ('0' is converted to 0)\n    '0' === false         // false     (different types)\n    NaN == NaN            // false     (NaN is never equal to itself)\n    NaN === NaN           // false\n    [] == []              // false     (different array objects)\n    [] === []             // false\n    {} == {}              // false     (different object references)\n    {} === {}             // false\n    ```"

    "answer": "**Arrow functions** (also known as \"lambda expressions\") provide a concise syntax for writing function expressions in JavaScript. Introduced in ES6, arrow functions are often shorter and more readable, especially for simple operations or callbacks.\n\n    #### Key Features:\n    - Arrow functions do **not** have their own `this`, `arguments`, `super`, or `new.target` bindings. They inherit these from their surrounding (lexical) context.\n    - They are best suited for non-method functions, such as callbacks or simple computations.\n    - Arrow functions **cannot** be used as constructors and do not have a `prototype` property.\n    - They also cannot be used with `new`, `yield`, or as generator functions.\n\n    #### Syntax Examples:\n\n    ```javascript\n    const arrowFunc1 = (a, b) => a + b;    // Multiple parameters, returns a + b\n    const arrowFunc2 = a => a * 10;        // Single parameter (parentheses optional), returns a * 10\n    const arrowFunc3 = () => {};           // No parameters, returns undefined\n    const arrowFunc4 = (a, b) => {\n      // Multiple statements require curly braces and explicit return\n      const sum = a + b;\n      return sum * 2;\n    };\n    ```"

You can assign a function to a variable.\n    2. You can pass a function as an argument to another function.\n    3. You can return a function from another function.\n\n    This capability enables powerful patterns like callbacks, higher-order functions, event handling, and functional programming in JavaScript.\n    \n    For example, the handler function below is assigned to a variable and then passed as an argument to the `addEventListener` method.\n\n    ```javascript\n    const handler = () => console.log(\"This is a click handler function\");\n    document.addEventListener(\"click\", handler);\n    ```"

    "title": "### What is the purpose of the let keyword",
    "answer": "The `let` keyword in JavaScript is used to declare a **block-scoped local variable**. This means that variables declared with `let` are only accessible within the block, statement, or expression where they are defined. This is a significant improvement over the older `var` keyword, which is function-scoped (or globally-scoped if declared outside a function), and does not respect block-level scoping.\n\n    #### Key Features of `let`:\n    - **Block Scope:** The variable exists only within the nearest enclosing block (e.g., inside an `{}` pair).\n    - **No Hoisting Issues:** While `let` declarations are hoisted, they are not initialized until the code defining them is executed. Accessing them before declaration results in a ReferenceError (temporal dead zone).\n    - **No Redeclaration:** The same variable cannot be declared twice in the same scope with `let`.\n\n    #### Example:\n\n    ```javascript\n    let counter = 30;\n    if (counter === 30) {\n      let counter = 31;\n      console.log(counter); // Output: 31 (block-scoped variable inside if-block)\n    }\n    console.log(counter); // Output: 30 (outer variable, unaffected by inner block)\n    ```javascript\n\n    In this example, the `counter` inside the `if` block is a separate variable from the one outside. The `let` keyword ensures that both have their own distinct scope.\n\n    In summary, you need to use `let` when you want variables to be limited to the block in which they are defined, preventing accidental overwrites and bugs related to variable scope."

    "answer": "The keyword `let` was chosen because it originates from mathematical notation, where \"let\" is used to introduce new variables (for example, \"let x = 5\"). This term was adopted by several early programming languages such as Scheme and BASIC, establishing a tradition in computer science. JavaScript follows this convention by using `let` to declare variables with block scope, providing a modern alternative to `var`. The choice helps make the language more familiar to programmers coming from other languages and aligns with the mathematical practice of variable assignment."

    "title": "### How do you redeclare variables in a switch block without an error",
    "answer": "When you try to redeclare variables using `let` or `const` in multiple `case` clauses of a `switch` statement, you will get a SyntaxError. This happens because, in JavaScript, all `case` clauses within a `switch` statement share the same block scope. For example:\n    \n    ```javascript\n    let counter = 1;\n    switch (x) {\n      case 0:\n        let name;\n        break;\n      case 1:\n        let name; // SyntaxError: Identifier 'name' has already been declared\n        break;\n    }\n    ```javascript\n    \n    To avoid this error, you can create a new block scope within each `case` clause by wrapping the code in curly braces `{}`. This way, each `let` or `const` declaration is scoped only to that block, and redeclaration errors are avoided:\n    \n    ```javascript\n    let counter = 1;\n    switch (x) {\n      case 0: {\n        let name;\n        // code for case 0\n        break;\n      }\n      case 1: {\n        let name; // No SyntaxError\n        // code for case 1\n        break;\n      }\n    }\n    ```javascript\n    \n    That means, to safely redeclare variables in different cases of a switch statement, wrap each case’s code in its own block using curly braces. This ensures each variable declaration is scoped to its specific case block."

During this time, the variable exists in scope but **cannot be accessed**, and attempting to do so results in a `ReferenceError`.\n    \n    This behavior is part of **JavaScript's ES6 (ECMAScript 2015)** specification and applies **only to variables declared with `let` and `const`**, not `var`. Variables declared with `var` are **hoisted** and initialized with `undefined`, so accessing them before the declaration does not throw an error, though it can lead to unexpected results.\n    \n    #### Example\n    \n    ```javascript\n    function someMethod() {\n        console.log(counter1); // Output: undefined (due to var hoisting)\n        console.log(counter2); // Throws ReferenceError (TDZ for let)\n    \n        var counter1 = 1;\n        let counter2 = 2;\n    }\n    ```"

    "answer": "The callbacks are needed because javascript is an event driven language. That means instead of waiting for a response, javascript will keep executing while listening for other events.\n    Let's take an example with the first function invoking an API call(simulated by setTimeout) and the next function which logs the message.\n\n    ```javascript\n    function firstFunction() {\n      // Simulate a code delay\n      setTimeout(function () {\n        console.log(\"First function called\");\n      }, 1000);\n    }\n    function secondFunction() {\n      console.log(\"Second function called\");\n    }\n    firstFunction();\n    secondFunction();\n\n    // Output:\n    // Second function called\n    // First function called\n    ```javascript\n\n    As observed from the output, javascript didn't wait for the response of the first function and the remaining code block got executed. So callbacks are used in a way to make sure that certain code doesn’t execute until the other code finishes execution."

    "answer": "JavaScript’s \"use strict\" directive is used to opt into a stricter parsing and error-handling mode for your scripts or functions. It helps catch common bugs, makes your code more secure, and prepares it for future versions of JavaScript.\n\n    Strict Mode is a new feature in ECMAScript 5 that allows you to place a program, or a function, in a “strict” operating context. This way it prevents certain actions from being taken and throws more exceptions. The literal expression `\"use strict\";` instructs the browser to use the javascript code in the Strict mode. This also enables block-scoped variables."

    "title": "### Why do you need strict mode",
    "answer": "Strict mode is useful to write \"secure\" JavaScript by notifying \"bad syntax\" into real errors.

    "answer": "Event capturing is a phase of event propagation in which an event is first intercepted by the outermost ancestor element, then travels downward through the DOM hierarchy until it reaches the target (innermost) element.\n\n    To handle events during the capturing phase, you need to pass `true` as the third argument to the `addEventListener` method.\n\n     ```javascript\n      <div>\n        <button class=\"child\">Hello</button>\n      </div>\n\n      <script>\n        const parent = document.querySelector(\"div\");\n        const child = document.querySelector(\".child\");\n\n        // Capturing phase: parent listener (runs first)\n        parent.addEventListener(\"click\", function () {\n          console.log(\"Parent (capturing)\");\n        }, true); // `true` enables capturing\n\n        // Bubbling phase: child listener (runs after)\n        child.addEventListener(\"click\", function () {\n          console.log(\"Child (bubbling)\");\n        });\n      </script>\n      // Parent (capturing)\n      // Child (bubbling)\n     ```"

    "title": "### What is event bubbling",
    "answer": "Event bubbling is a type of event propagation in which an event first triggers on the innermost target element (the one the user interacted with), and then bubbles up through its ancestors in the DOM hierarchy — eventually reaching the outermost elements, like the document or window.\n\n    By default, event listeners in JavaScript are triggered during the bubbling phase, unless specified otherwise.\n\n    ```javascript\n    <div>\n      <button class=\"child\">Hello</button>\n    </div>\n\n    <script>\n      const parent = document.querySelector(\"div\");\n      const child = document.querySelector(\".child\");\n\n      // Bubbling phase (default)\n      parent.addEventListener(\"click\", function () {\n        console.log(\"Parent\");\n      });\n\n      child.addEventListener(\"click\", function () {\n        console.log(\"Child\");\n      });\n    </script>\n    //Child\n    //Parent\n    ```javascript\n\n    Here, at first, the event triggers on the child button. Thereafter it bubbles up and triggers the parent div's event handler."

If the index value is not equal to -1 then it means the substring exists in the main string.\n\n      ```javascript\n      var mainString = \"hello\",\n        subString = \"hell\";\n      mainString.indexOf(subString) !== -1;\n      ```javascript\n\n      3. **Using RegEx:** The advanced solution is using Regular expression's test method(`RegExp.test`), which allows for testing for against regular expressions\n\n      ```javascript\n      var mainString = \"hello\",\n        regex = /hell/;\n      regex.test(mainString);\n      ```"

    "answer": "Tree shaking is a form of dead code elimination. It means that unused modules will not be included in the bundle during the build process and for that it relies on the static structure of ES2015 module syntax,( i.e. import and export). Initially this has been popularized by the ES2015 module bundler `rollup`, these days practically all bundlers use this technique."

    "title": "### What is the need of tree shaking",
    "answer": "Tree Shaking can significantly reduce the code size in any application. i.e, The less code we send over the wire the more performant the application will be. For example, if we just want to create a “Hello World” Application using SPA frameworks then it will take around a few MBs, but by tree shaking it can bring down the size to just a few hundred KBs. Tree shaking is implemented in Rollup and Webpack bundlers."

    "answer": "The **`freeze()`** method is used to freeze an object. Freezing an object does not allow adding new properties to an object, prevents removing, and prevents changing the enumerability, configurability, or writability of existing properties. i.e. It returns the passed object and does not create a frozen copy.\n\n      ```javascript\n      const obj = {\n        prop: 100,\n      };\n\n      Object.freeze(obj);\n      obj.prop = 200; // Throws an error in strict mode\n\n      console.log(obj.prop); //100\n      ```javascript\n\n      Remember freezing is only applied to the top-level properties in objects but not for nested objects.\n      For example, let's try to freeze user object which has employment details as nested object and observe that details have been changed.\n\n      ```javascript\n      const user = {\n        name: \"John\",\n        employment: {\n          department: \"IT\",\n        },\n      };\n\n      Object.freeze(user);\n      user.employment.department = \"HR\";\n      ```javascript\n\n      **Note:** It causes a TypeError if the argument passed is not an object."

    "title": "### How does synchronous iteration works",
    "answer": "Synchronous iteration was introduced in ES6 and it works with below set of components,\n\n      **Iterable:** It is an object which can be iterated over via a method whose key is Symbol.iterator.\n\n      **Iterator:** It is an object returned by invoking `[Symbol.iterator]()` on an iterable. This iterator object wraps each iterated element in an object and returns it via `next()` method one by one.\n\n      **IteratorResult:** It is an object returned by `next()` method. The object contains two properties; the `value` property contains an iterated element and the `done` property determines whether the element is the last element or not.\n\n      Let's demonstrate synchronous iteration with an array as below\n\n      ```javascript\n      const iterable = [\"one\", \"two\", \"three\"];\n      const iterator = iterable[Symbol.iterator]();\n      console.log(iterator.next()); // { value: 'one', done: false }\n      console.log(iterator.next()); // { value: 'two', done: false }\n      console.log(iterator.next()); // { value: 'three', done: false }\n      console.log(iterator.next()); // { value: 'undefined, done: true }\n      ```"

    "answer": "The event loop is a process that continuously monitors both the call stack and the event queue and checks whether or not the call stack is empty. If the call stack is empty and there are pending events in the event queue, the event loop dequeues the event from the event queue and pushes it to the call stack. The call stack executes the event, and any additional events generated during the execution are added to the end of the event queue.\n\n      **Note:** The event loop allows Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O operations, even though JavaScript is single-threaded, by offloading operations to the system kernel whenever possible. Since most modern kernels are multi-threaded, they can handle multiple operations executing in the background."

    "title": "### What is the call stack",
    "answer": "Call Stack is a data structure for javascript interpreters to keep track of function calls(creates execution context) in the program. It has two major actions,\n\n      1. Whenever you call a function for its execution, you are pushing it to the stack.\n      2. Whenever the execution is completed, the function is popped out of the stack.\n\n      Let's take an example and it's state representation in a diagram format\n\n      ```javascript\n      function hungry() {\n        eatFruits();\n      }\n      function eatFruits() {\n        return \"I'm eating fruits\";\n      }\n\n      // Invoke the `hungry` function\n      hungry();\n      ```javascript\n\n      The above code processed in a call stack as below,\n\n      3. Add the `hungry()` function to the call stack list and execute the code.\n      4. Add the `eatFruits()` function to the call stack list and execute the code.\n      5. Delete the `eatFruits()` function from our call stack list.\n      6. Delete the `hungry()` function from the call stack list since there are no items anymore.\n\n      ![Screenshot](images/call-stack.png)"

    "answer": "The event queue follows the queue data structure. It stores async callbacks to be added to the call stack. It is also known as the Callback Queue or Macrotask Queue.\n\n      Whenever the call stack receives an async function, it is moved into the Web API. Based on the function, Web API executes it and awaits the result. Once it is finished, it moves the callback into the event queue (the callback of a promise is moved into the microtask queue).\n\n      The event loop constantly checks whether or not the call stack is empty. Once the call stack is empty and there is a callback in the event queue, the event loop moves the callback into the call stack. But if there is a callback in the microtask queue as well, it is moved first. The microtask queue has a higher priority than the event queue."

    "title": "### How do you declare a namespace",
    "answer": "Even though JavaScript lacks namespaces, we can use Objects, an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) or `let`/`const` to create namespaces.\n\n      1. **Using Object Literal Notation:** Let's wrap variables and functions inside an Object literal which acts as a namespace. After that you can access them using object notation\n\n         ```javascript\n         var namespaceOne = {\n             function func1() {\n                 console.log(\"This is a first definition\");\n             }\n         }\n         var namespaceTwo = {\n               function func1() {\n                   console.log(\"This is a second definition\");\n               }\n           }\n         namespaceOne.func1(); // This is a first definition\n         namespaceTwo.func1(); // This is a second definition\n         ```javascript\n\n      2. **Using IIFE (Immediately invoked function expression):** The outer pair of parentheses of IIFE creates a local scope for all the code inside of it and makes the anonymous function a function expression. Due to that, you can create the same function in two different function expressions to act as a namespace.\n\n         ```javascript\n         (function () {\n           function fun1() {\n             console.log(\"This is a first definition\");\n           }\n           fun1();\n         })();\n\n         (function () {\n           function fun1() {\n             console.log(\"This is a second definition\");\n           }\n           fun1();\n         })();\n         ```javascript\n\n      3. **Using a block and a let/const declaration:** In ECMAScript 6, you can simply use a block and a let declaration to restrict the scope of a variable to a block.\n\n         ```javascript\n         {\n           let myFunction = function fun1() {\n             console.log(\"This is a first definition\");\n           };\n           myFunction();\n         }\n         //myFunction(): ReferenceError: myFunction is not defined.\n\n         {\n           let myFunction = function fun1() {\n             console.log(\"This is a second definition\");\n           };\n           myFunction();\n         }\n         //myFunction(): ReferenceError: myFunction is not defined.\n         ```"

Hence, the output of the second loop is `4 4 4 4`.\n\n      Whereas in the second loop, the variable i is declared as the `let` keyword it becomes a block scoped variable and it holds a new value(0, 1 ,2 3) for each iteration.

    "title": "### What is the difference between Shallow and Deep copy",
    "answer": "There are two ways to copy an object,\n\n      **Shallow Copy:**\n      Shallow copy is a bitwise copy of an object. A new object is created that has an exact copy of the values in the original object. If any of the fields of the object are references to other objects, just the reference addresses are copied i.e., only the memory address is copied.\n\n      **Example**\n\n      ```javascript\n      var empDetails = {\n        name: \"John\",\n        age: 25,\n        expertise: \"Software Developer\",\n      };\n      ```javascript\n\n      to create a duplicate\n\n      ```javascript\n      var empDetailsShallowCopy = empDetails; //Shallow copying!\n      ```javascript\n\n      if we change some property value in the duplicate one like this:\n\n      ```javascript\n      empDetailsShallowCopy.name = \"Johnson\";\n      ```javascript\n\n      The above statement will also change the name of `empDetails`, since we have a shallow copy. That means we're losing the original data as well.\n\n      **Deep copy:**\n      A deep copy copies all fields, and makes copies of dynamically allocated memory pointed to by the fields. A deep copy occurs when an object is copied along with the objects to which it refers.\n\n      **Example**\n\n      ```javascript\n      var empDetails = {\n        name: \"John\",\n        age: 25,\n        expertise: \"Software Developer\",\n      };\n      ```javascript\n\n      Create a deep copy by using the properties from the original object into new variable\n\n      ```javascript\n      var empDetailsDeepCopy = {\n        name: empDetails.name,\n        age: empDetails.age,\n        expertise: empDetails.expertise,\n      };\n      ```javascript\n\n      Now if you change `empDetailsDeepCopy.name`, it will only affect `empDetailsDeepCopy` & not `empDetails`"

Prepend an array with + operator will convert an array to false, the negation will make it true and finally converting the result will produce value '1': +(!(+[])) === 1\n\n      By applying the above rules, we can derive below conditions\n\n      ```javascript\n      (![] + [] === \"false\" + !+[]) === 1;\n      ```javascript\n\n      Now the character pattern would be created as below,\n\n      ```javascript\n            s               e               l               f\n       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n       (![] + [])[3] + (![] + [])[4] + (![] + [])[2] + (![] + [])[0]\n       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n      (![] + [])[+!+[]+!+[]+!+[]] +\n      (![] + [])[+!+[]+!+[]+!+[]+!+[]] +\n      (![] + [])[+!+[]+!+[]] +\n      (![] + [])[+[]]\n      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n      (![]+[])[+!+[]+!+[]+!+[]]+(![]+[])[+!+[]+!+[]+!+[]+!+[]]+(![]+[])[+!+[]+!+[]]+(![]+[])[+[]]\n      ```"

    "answer": "Until a few days back, One shortcoming of native promises is no direct way to cancel a fetch request. But the new `AbortController` from js specification allows you to use a signal to abort one or multiple fetch calls.\n     The basic flow of cancelling a fetch request would be as below,\n\n     1. Create an `AbortController` instance\n     2. Get the signal property of an instance and pass the signal as a fetch option for signal\n     3. Call the AbortController's abort property to cancel all fetches that use that signal\n        For example, passing the same signal to multiple fetch calls will cancel all requests with that signal,\n\n     ```javascript\n     const controller = new AbortController();\n     const { signal } = controller;\n\n     fetch(\"http://localhost:8000\", { signal })\n       .then((response) => {\n         console.log(`Request 1 is complete!`);\n       })\n       .catch((e) => {\n         if (e.name === \"AbortError\") {\n           // We know it's been canceled!\n         }\n       });\n\n     fetch(\"http://localhost:8000\", { signal })\n       .then((response) => {\n         console.log(`Request 2 is complete!`);\n       })\n       .catch((e) => {\n         if (e.name === \"AbortError\") {\n           // We know it's been canceled!\n         }\n       });\n\n     // Wait 2 seconds to abort both requests\n     setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), 2000);\n     ```"

    "answer": "Web speech API is used to enable modern browsers recognize and synthesize speech(i.e, voice data into web apps). This API was introduced by W3C Community in the year 2012. It has two main parts:\n\n     1. **SpeechRecognition (Asynchronous Speech Recognition or Speech-to-Text):** It provides the ability to recognize voice context from an audio input and respond accordingly. This is accessed by the `SpeechRecognition` interface.\n        The example below shows how to use this API to get text from speech,\n\n     ```javascript\n     window.SpeechRecognition =\n       window.webkitSpeechRecognition || window.SpeechRecognition; // webkitSpeechRecognition for Chrome and SpeechRecognition for FF\n     const recognition = new window.SpeechRecognition();\n     recognition.onresult = (event) => {\n       // SpeechRecognitionEvent type\n       const speechToText = event.results[0][0].transcript;\n       console.log(speechToText);\n     };\n     recognition.start();\n     ```javascript\n\n     In this API, browser is going to ask you for permission to use your microphone\n\n     2. **SpeechSynthesis (Text-to-Speech):** It provides the ability to recognize voice context from an audio input and respond. This is accessed by the `SpeechSynthesis` interface.\n        For example, the below code is used to get voice/speech from text,\n\n     ```javascript\n     if (\"speechSynthesis\" in window) {\n       var speech = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance(\"Hello World!\");\n       speech.lang = \"en-US\";\n       window.speechSynthesis.speak(speech);\n     }\n     ```javascript\n\n     The above examples can be tested on chrome(33+) browser's developer console.\n     **Note:** This API is still a working draft and only available in Chrome and Firefox browsers(ofcourse Chrome only implemented the specification)"

This throttle occurs when successive calls are triggered due to callback nesting(certain depth) or after a certain number of successive intervals.\n     Note: The older browsers have a minimum delay of 10ms.\n     **Nodejs:** They have a minimum delay of 1ms. This throttle happens when the delay is larger than 2147483647 or less than 1.\n     The best example to explain this timeout throttling behavior is the order of below code snippet.\n\n     ```javascript\n     function runMeFirst() {\n       console.log(\"My script is initialized\");\n     }\n     setTimeout(runMeFirst, 0);\n     console.log(\"Script loaded\");\n     ```javascript\n\n     and the output would be in\n\n     ```cmd\n     Script loaded\n     My script is initialized\n     ```javascript\n\n     If you don't use `setTimeout`, the order of logs will be sequential.\n\n     ```javascript\n     function runMeFirst() {\n       console.log(\"My script is initialized\");\n     }\n     runMeFirst();\n     console.log(\"Script loaded\");\n     ```javascript\n\n     and the output is,\n\n     ```cmd\n     My script is initialized\n     Script loaded\n     ```"

    "answer": "A task is any javascript code/program which is scheduled to be run by the standard mechanisms such as initially starting to run a program, run an event callback, or an interval or timeout being fired. All these tasks are scheduled on a task queue.\n     Below are the list of use cases to add tasks to the task queue,\n\n     1. When a new javascript program is executed directly from console or running by the `<script>` element, the task will be added to the task queue.\n     2. When an event fires, the event callback added to task queue\n     3. When a setTimeout or setInterval is reached, the corresponding callback added to task queue"

    "title": "### What is microtask",
    "answer": "A microtask is a type of JavaScript callback that is scheduled to run immediately after the currently executing script and before the next event loop tick. Microtasks are executed after the current task completes and before any new tasks (macrotasks) are run. This ensures a fast and predictable update cycle.\n\n     Common sources of microtasks stored in the microtask queue include:\n\n     1. **Promises:**\n        When a Promise is resolved or rejected, its `.then()`, `.catch()`, and `.finally()` callbacks are placed in the microtask queue.\n\n        ```javascript\n        Promise.resolve().then(() => {\n         console.log('Microtask from a Promise');\n        });\n        ```javascript\n\n      2. **queueMicrotask():**\n     \n         A method that explicitly schedules a function to be run in the microtask queue.\n\n         ```javascript\n          queueMicrotask(() => {\n             console.log('Microtask from  queueMicrotask');\n           });\n         ```javascript\n\n      3. **MutationObserver callbacks:**\n\n         Observers changes in the DOM and triggers a callback as a microtask.\n\n         ```javascript\n            const observer = new MutationObserver(() => {\n              console.log('Microtask from MutationObserver');\n            })\n            observer.observe(document.body, {childList: true});\n         ```javascript\n\n      4. **await:**  \n         Await internally uses Promises, so the code after `await` is scheduled as a microtask.\n\n         ```javascript\n          async function asyncFunction() {\n            await null;\n            console.log('Microtask from Await'); // Schedule this code as microtask\n          }\n         ```javascript\n     **Note:** All of these microtasks are processed in the same turn of the event loop."

    "answer": "The `queueMicrotask` function is used to schedule a microtask, which is a function that will be executed asynchronously in the microtask queue. The purpose of `queueMicrotask` is to ensure that a function is executed after the current task has finished, but before the browser performs any rendering or handles user events.\n\n     Example:\n\n     ```javascript\n     console.log(\"Start\"); //1\n\n     queueMicrotask(() => {\n       console.log(\"Inside microtask\"); // 3\n     });\n\n     console.log(\"End\"); //2\n     ```javascript\n\n     By using queueMicrotask, you can ensure that certain tasks or callbacks are executed at the earliest opportunity during the JavaScript event loop, making it useful for performing work that needs to be done asynchronously but with higher priority than regular `setTimeout` or `setInterval` callbacks."

You can use this library in typescript code as below,\n\n     ```javascript\n     declare var customLibrary;\n     ```javascript\n\n     In the runtime, typescript will provide the type to the `customLibrary` variable as `any` type.

    "title": "### How do you prevent promises swallowing errors",
    "answer": "While using asynchronous code, JavaScript’s ES6 promises can make your life a lot easier without having callback pyramids and error handling on every second line. But Promises have some pitfalls and the biggest one is swallowing errors by default.\n\n     Let's say you expect to print an error to the console for all the below cases,\n\n     ```javascript\n     Promise.resolve(\"promised value\").then(function () {\n       throw new Error(\"error\");\n     });\n\n     Promise.reject(\"error value\").catch(function () {\n       throw new Error(\"error\");\n     });\n\n     new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {\n       throw new Error(\"error\");\n     });\n     ```javascript\n\n     But there are many modern JavaScript environments that won't print any errors. You can fix this problem in different ways,\n\n     1. **Add catch block at the end of each chain:** You can add catch block to the end of each of your promise chains\n\n        ```javascript\n        Promise.resolve(\"promised value\")\n          .then(function () {\n            throw new Error(\"error\");\n          })\n          .catch(function (error) {\n            console.error(error.stack);\n          });\n        ```javascript\n\n        But it is quite difficult to type for each promise chain and verbose too.\n\n     2. **Add done method:** You can replace first solution's then and catch blocks with done method\n\n        ```javascript\n        Promise.resolve(\"promised value\").done(function () {\n          throw new Error(\"error\");\n        });\n        ```javascript\n\n        Let's say you want to fetch data using HTTP and later perform processing on the resulting data asynchronously. You can write `done` block as below,\n\n        ```javascript\n        getDataFromHttp()\n          .then(function (result) {\n            return processDataAsync(result);\n          })\n          .done(function (processed) {\n            displayData(processed);\n          });\n        ```javascript\n\n        In future, if the processing library API changed to synchronous then you can remove `done` block as below,\n\n        ```javascript\n        getDataFromHttp().then(function (result) {\n          return displayData(processDataAsync(result));\n        });\n        ```javascript\n\n        and then you forgot to add `done` block to `then` block leads to silent errors.\n\n     3. **Extend ES6 Promises by Bluebird:**\n        Bluebird extends the ES6 Promises API to avoid the issue in the second solution. This library has a “default” onRejection handler which will print all errors from rejected Promises to stderr. After installation, you can process unhandled rejections\n\n        ```javascript\n        Promise.onPossiblyUnhandledRejection(function (error) {\n          throw error;\n        });\n        ```javascript\n\n        and discard a rejection, just handle it with an empty catch\n\n        ```javascript\n        Promise.reject(\"error value\").catch(function () {});\n        ```"

    "title": "### How do you make an object iterable in javascript",
    "answer": "By default, plain objects are not iterable. But you can make the object iterable by defining a `Symbol.iterator` property on it.\n\n     Let's demonstrate this with an example,\n\n     ```javascript\n     const collection = {\n       one: 1,\n       two: 2,\n       three: 3,\n       [Symbol.iterator]() {\n         const values = Object.keys(this);\n         let i = 0;\n         return {\n           next: () => {\n             return {\n               value: this[values[i++]],\n               done: i > values.length,\n             };\n           },\n         };\n       },\n     };\n\n     const iterator = collection[Symbol.iterator]();\n\n     console.log(iterator.next()); // → {value: 1, done: false}\n     console.log(iterator.next()); // → {value: 2, done: false}\n     console.log(iterator.next()); // → {value: 3, done: false}\n     console.log(iterator.next()); // → {value: undefined, done: true}\n     ```javascript\n\n     The above process can be simplified using a generator function,\n\n     ```javascript\n     const collection = {\n       one: 1,\n       two: 2,\n       three: 3,\n       [Symbol.iterator]: function* () {\n         for (let key in this) {\n           yield this[key];\n         }\n       },\n     };\n     const iterator = collection[Symbol.iterator]();\n     console.log(iterator.next()); // {value: 1, done: false}\n     console.log(iterator.next()); // {value: 2, done: false}\n     console.log(iterator.next()); // {value: 3, done: false}\n     console.log(iterator.next()); // {value: undefined, done: true}\n     ```"

    "title": "### What is a Proper Tail Call",
    "answer": "First, we should know about tail call before talking about \"Proper Tail Call\". A tail call is a subroutine or function call performed as the final action of a calling function. Whereas **Proper tail call(PTC)** is a technique where the program or code will not create additional stack frames for a recursion when the function call is a tail call.\n\n     For example, the below classic or head recursion of factorial function relies on stack for each step. Each step need to be processed upto `n * factorial(n - 1)`\n\n     ```javascript\n     function factorial(n) {\n       if (n === 0) {\n         return 1;\n       }\n       return n * factorial(n - 1);\n     }\n     console.log(factorial(5)); //120\n     ```javascript\n\n     But if you use Tail recursion functions, they keep passing all the necessary data it needs down the recursion without relying on the stack.\n\n     ```javascript\n     function factorial(n, acc = 1) {\n       if (n === 0) {\n         return acc;\n       }\n       return factorial(n - 1, n * acc);\n     }\n     console.log(factorial(5)); //120\n     ```javascript\n\n     The above pattern returns the same output as the first one. But the accumulator keeps track of total as an argument without using stack memory on recursive calls."

Let's take a look.\n\n     1. **Using slice and reverse methods:**\n        In this case, just invoke the `slice()` method on the array to create a shallow copy followed by `reverse()` method call on the copy.\n\n        ```javascript\n        const originalArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n        const newArray = originalArray.slice().reverse(); //Slice an array gives a new copy\n\n        console.log(originalArray); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n        console.log(newArray); // [ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n        ```javascript\n\n     2. **Using spread and reverse methods:**\n        In this case, let's use the spread syntax (...) to create a copy of the array followed by `reverse()` method call on the copy.\n\n        ```javascript\n        const originalArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n        const newArray = [...originalArray].reverse();\n\n        console.log(originalArray); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n        console.log(newArray); // [ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n        ```javascript\n\n     3. **Using reduce and spread methods:**\n        Here execute a reducer function on an array elements and append the accumulated array on right side using spread syntax\n\n        ```javascript\n        const originalArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n        const newArray = originalArray.reduce((accumulator, value) => {\n          return [value, ...accumulator];\n        }, []);\n\n        console.log(originalArray); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n        console.log(newArray); // [ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n        ```javascript\n\n     4. **Using reduceRight and spread methods:**\n        Here execute a right reducer function(i.e. opposite direction of reduce method) on an array elements and append the accumulated array on left side using spread syntax\n\n        ```javascript\n        const originalArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n        const newArray = originalArray.reduceRight((accumulator, value) => {\n          return [...accumulator, value];\n        }, []);\n\n        console.log(originalArray); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n        console.log(newArray); // [ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n        ```javascript\n\n     5. **Using reduceRight and push methods:**\n        Here execute a right reducer function(i.e. opposite direction of reduce method) on an array elements and push the iterated value to the accumulator\n\n        ```javascript\n        const originalArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n        const newArray = originalArray.reduceRight((accumulator, value) => {\n          accumulator.push(value);\n          return accumulator;\n        }, []);\n\n        console.log(originalArray); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n        console.log(newArray); // [ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n        ```"

    "title": "### What is debouncing?",
    "answer": "Debouncing is a programming technique used to limit how often a function is executed. Specifically, it ensures that a function is only triggered after a certain amount of time has passed since it was last invoked. This prevents unnecessary or excessive function calls, which can help optimize performance and reduce unnecessary CPU usage or API requests.\n\n    For example, when a user types in a search box, you typically want to wait until they’ve finished typing before fetching suggestions. Without debouncing, an API call would be triggered on every keystroke, potentially causing performance issues. With debouncing, the function call is postponed until the user stops typing for a specified period (e.g., 300ms). If the user types again before this time elapses, the timer resets.\n\n    **Typical use cases for debouncing include:**\n\n    *   Search box suggestions (wait until typing pauses before fetching results)\n    *   Auto-saving text fields (save only after the user stops typing)\n    *   Preventing double-clicks on buttons\n    *   Handling window resize or scroll events efficiently\n\n    **Example Debounce Function:**\n\n    JavaScript\n\n    ```css\n    function debounce(func, timeout = 500) {\n      let timer;\n      return function (...args) {\n        clearTimeout(timer);\n        timer = setTimeout(() => {\n          func.apply(this, args);\n        }, timeout);\n      };\n    }\n    ```javascript\n\n    **Usage Example:**\n\n    JavaScript\n\n    ```css\n    function fetchResults() {\n      console.log(\"Fetching input suggestions\");\n    }\n    const processChange = debounce(fetchResults, 300);\n\n    // Attach to input element\n    <input type=\"text\" onkeyup=\"processChange()\" />\n\n    // Attach to button\n    <button onclick=\"processChange()\">Click me</button>\n\n    // Attach to window event\n    window.addEventListener(\"scroll\", processChange);\n    ```javascript\n\n    **How it works:**  \n    When `processChange` is invoked (e.g., by typing or clicking), any pending execution is canceled, and the function is scheduled to run after the specified delay. If another event occurs before the delay is up, the timer resets, and the function will only run after events have stopped for the delay duration.\n\n    Debouncing is an essential tool for improving user experience and application performance, especially when dealing with events that can fire rapidly and repeatedly."

    "answer": "Throttling is a programming technique used to control the rate at which a function is executed. When an event is triggered continuously—such as during window resizing, scrolling, or mouse movement—throttling ensures that the associated event handler is not called more often than a specified interval. This helps improve performance by reducing the number of expensive function calls and preventing performance bottlenecks.\n\n      **Common use cases:**\n\n      *   Window resize events\n      *   Scroll events\n      *   Mouse movement or drag events\n      *   API rate limiting\n\n      **How does throttling work?**  \n      Throttling will execute the function at most once every specified time interval, ignoring additional calls until the interval has passed.\n\n      **Example: Throttle Implementation and Usage**\n\n      JavaScript\n\n      ```css\n      // Simple throttle function: allows 'func' to run at most once every 'limit' ms\n      function throttle(func, limit) {\n        let inThrottle = false;\n        return function(...args) {\n          if (!inThrottle) {\n            func.apply(this, args);\n            inThrottle = true;\n            setTimeout(() => (inThrottle = false), limit);\n          }\n        };\n      }\n\n      // Usage: throttling a scroll event handler\n      function handleScrollAnimation() {\n        console.log('Scroll event triggered');\n      }\n\n      window.addEventListener(\n        \"scroll\",\n        throttle(handleScrollAnimation, 100) // Will run at most once every 100ms\n      );\n      ```"

    "answer": "It is possible to check if a variable is an array instance using 3 different ways,\n\n     1. Array.isArray() method:\n\n        The `Array.isArray(value)` utility function is used to determine whether value is an array or not. This function returns a true boolean value if the variable is an array and a false value if it is not.\n\n        ```javascript\n        const numbers = [1, 2, 3];\n        const user = { name: \"John\" };\n        Array.isArray(numbers); // true\n        Array.isArray(user); //false\n        ```javascript\n\n     2. instanceof operator:\n\n        The instanceof operator is used to check the type of an array at run time. It returns true if the type of a variable is an Array other false for other type.\n\n        ```javascript\n        const numbers = [1, 2, 3];\n        const user = { name: \"John\" };\n        console.log(numbers instanceof Array); // true\n        console.log(user instanceof Array); // false\n        ```javascript\n\n     3.

Since there is a new space created for variable `b`, any update on this variable doesn't impact the variable `a`.\n\n     Pass by reference doesn't create a new space in memory but the new variable adopts a memory address of an initial variable. Non-primitives such as objects, arrays and functions gets the reference of the initiable variable. i.e, updating one value will impact the other variable.\n\n     ```javascript\n     let user1 = {\n       name: \"John\",\n       age: 27,\n     };\n     let user2 = user1;\n     user2.age = 30;\n\n     console.log(user1.age, user2.age); // 30, 30\n     ```javascript\n\n     In the above code snippet, updating the `age` property of one object will impact the other property due to the same reference."

    "title": "### What is the purpose of the this keyword in JavaScript?",
    "answer": "The `this` keyword in JavaScript refers to **the object that is executing the current function**. Its value is determined by **how a function is called**, not where it is defined.  `this` is essential for writing object-oriented and event-driven code, as it allows methods to interact with the data of the object they belong to.\n\n\n  **Example 1: this in a Global Context**\n\n  ```javascript\n  console.log(this);\n  ```javascript\n\n  - In a global context, this refers to the global object (e.g., window in a browser).\n\n  **Example 2: this in a Function**\n\n  ```javascript\n  function displayThis() {\n    console.log(this);\n  }\n\n  displayThis();\n  ```javascript\n\n  - In a regular function, this refers to the global object(window in browser and global in nodejs) for non-strict mode.  In strict mode, it's value is undefined.\n\n  **Example 3: this in a Method**\n\n  ```javascript\n  const person = {\n    name: \"John\",\n    greet: function () {\n      console.log(\"Hello, \" + this.name);\n    },\n  };\n\n  person.greet();\n  ```javascript\n\n  - In a method, this refers to the object that owns the method (person in the case).\n\n  **Example 4: this in an Event Handler**\n\n  ```javascript\n   document.getElementById(\"myButton\").addEventListener(\"click\", function () {\n            console.log(this);\n   });\n  ```javascript\n\n  - In an event handler, this refers to the element that triggered the event (the button in this case).\n\n  **Example 5: `this` with Arrow Functions**\n\n  ```javascript\n        const obj = {\n          age: 42,\n          regular: function() { console.log(this.age); },\n          arrow: () => { console.log(this.age); }\n        };\n        obj.regular(); // 42 (this refers to obj)\n        obj.arrow();   // undefined (this refers to the outer scope, not obj)\n  ```javascript\n  - Arrow functions do not have their own `this` binding; they inherit it from their surrounding (lexical) context.\n\n  **Example 6: this in Constructor Functions / Classes**\n    \n  ```javascript\n    function Person(name) {\n      this.name = name;\n    }\n    \n    const p1 = new Person('Sudheer');\n    console.log(p1.name); // Sudheer\n  ```javascript\n   - When used with new, this refers to the newly created object."

    "title": "### What are the uses of closures?",
    "answer": "Closures are a powerful feature in programming languages like JavaScript. They allow functions to retain access to variables from their containing (enclosing) scope even after the outer function has finished executing. This means that a function defined within another function can access variables from the outer function, even if the outer function has already returned.\n     Here are some common use cases of closures:\n\n- Data Privacy: Closures can be used to create private variables and methods. By defining variables within a function's scope and returning inner functions that have access to those variables, you can create a form of encapsulation, limiting access to certain data or functionality.\n\n- Function Factories: Closures are often used to create functions with pre-set parameters. This is useful when you need to create multiple functions with similar behavior but different configurations.\n\n- Callback Functions: Closures are frequently used in asynchronous programming, such as handling event listeners or AJAX requests. The inner function captures variables from the outer scope and can access them when the callback is invoked.\n\n- Memoization: Closures can be used for memoization, a technique to optimize performance by caching the results of expensive function calls. The inner function can remember the results of previous calls and return the cached result if the same input is provided again.\n\n- iterators and Generators: Closures can be used to create iterators and generators, which are essential for working with collections of data in modern JavaScript."

    "answer": "The execution context in JavaScript is a data structure that stores the information necessary for executing a piece of code. It includes the code itself, the values of the variables used in the code, and the scope chain. The scope chain is a list of objects that are used to resolve variable names.\n\nThe execution context has two phases:\n\n- Creation phase: In this phase, the JavaScript engine creates the execution context and sets up the script's environment. This includes creating the variable object and the scope chain.\n- Execution phase: In this phase, the JavaScript engine executes the code in the execution context. This includes evaluating expressions, assigning values to variables, and calling functions.\n\nThe execution context is created when a function is called. The function's code is then executed in the execution context. When the function returns, the execution context is destroyed."

    "title": "### What is the difference between map and forEach functions?",
    "answer": "Both map and forEach functions are used to iterate over an arrays but there are some differences in their functionality.\n\n    1. **Returning values:** The `map` method returns a new array with transformed elements whereas `forEach` method returns `undefined` eventhough both of them are doing the same job.\n\n    ```javascript\n      const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n      arr.map(x => x * x); // [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n      arr.forEach(x => x * x); //\n\n      The `forEach()` method in JavaScript always returns undefined. This is because forEach() is used to iterate over arrays and perform side effects on each element, rather than returning a `new array or transforming the original array`\n    ```javascript\n\n    2. **Chaining methods:** The `map` method is chainable. i.e, It can be attached with `reduce`, `filter`, `sort` and other methods as well. Whereas `forEach` cannot be attached with any other methods because it returns `undefined` value.\n\n    ```javascript\n    const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n    arr.map((x) => x * x).reduce((total, cur) => total + cur); // 55\n    arr.forEach((x) => x * x).reduce((total, cur) => total + cur); //Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefine(reading 'reduce')\n    ```javascript\n\n    3. **Mutation:** The `map` method doesn't mutate the original array by returning new array. Whereas `forEach` method also doesn't mutate the original array but it's callback is allowed to mutate the original array.\n\n    **Note:** Both these methods existed since ES5 onwards."

    "title": "### What are hidden classes?",
    "answer": "Since JavaScript is a dynamic programming language, you can add or remove properties and methods from objects on the fly at runtime. This nature of JavaScript increases the dynamic dictionary lookups(because objects implemented as HashTables in memory) for retrieving a property on an object.\n\n     Let's consider the following example to see how the additional properties `age` and `gender` added at runtime.\n\n     ```javascript\n     function Person(name) {\n       this.name = name;\n     }\n\n     var person1 = new Person(\"John\");\n     var person2 = new Person(\"Randy\");\n\n     person1.age = 40;\n     person1.gender = \"Male\";\n\n     person2.gender = \"Female\";\n     person2.age = 50;\n     ```javascript\n\n     As a result, this behavior leads to lower JavaScript performance compared to the contiguous buffer method used in non-dynamic languages. The V8 engine provided a solution named **hidden classes** to optimize the access time when retrieving a property on an object. This optimization is achieved by sharing hidden classes among objects created in a similar fashion. These hidden classes are attached to each and every object to track its shape.\n\n     When V8 engine sees the constructor function(e.g, Person) is declared, it creates a hidden class (let's say Class01) without any offsets. Once the first property assignment statement (`this.name = name`) is executed, V8 engine will create a new hidden class (let's say Class02), inheriting all properties from the previous hidden class (Class01), and assign the property to offset 0. This process enables compiler to skip dictionary lookup when you try to retrieve the same property(i.e, name). Instead, V8 will directly point to Class02. The same procedure happens when you add new properties to the object.\n\n     For example, adding `age` and `gender` properties to `Person` constructor leads to transition of hidden classes(Class02 -> Class03 -> Class04). If you create a second object(Person2) based on the same Person object, both Class01 and Class02 hidden classes are going to be shared. However, the hidden classes Class03 and Class04 cannot be shared because second object has been modified with a different order of properties assignment.\n\n     Since both the objects(person1 and person2) do not share the hidden classes, now V8 engine cannot use **Inline Caching** technique for the faster access of properties."

    "title": "### What is inline caching?",
    "answer": "Inline caching is an optimization technique based on the observation that repeated calls to same function tends to occur on same type of objects. The V8 compiler stores a cache of the type of objects that were passed as a parameter in recent method calls. Upon next time when same function is called, compiler can directly search for the type in cache.\n\nLet's consider an example where the compiler stores the shape type in cache for repeated calls in the loop.\n\n```js\nlet shape = { width: 30, height: 20 }; // Compiler store the type in cache as { width: <int>, height: <int>} after repeated calls\n\nfunction area(obj) {\n  //Calculate area\n}\nfor (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {\n  area(shape);\n}\n```javascript\n\nAfter few successful calls of the same area method to its same hidden class, V8 engine omits the hidden class lookup and simply adds the offset of the property to the object pointer itself. As a result, it increases the execution speed.\n\nThere are mainly 3 types of inline caching possible:"

    "answer": "The requestAnimationFrame() method in JavaScript is used to schedule a function to be called before the next repaint of the browser window, allowing you to create smooth, efficient animations. It's primarily used for animations and visual updates, making it an essential tool for improving performance when you're animating elements on the web.\n\n```javascript\nconst element = document.getElementById(\"myElement\");\nfunction animate() {\n  let currentPosition = parseInt(window.getComputedStyle(element).left, 10);\n\n  // Move the element 2px per frame\n  currentPosition += 2;\n  element.style.left = currentPosition + \"px\";\n  // If the element hasn't moved off-screen, request the next frame\n  if (currentPosition < window.innerWidth) {\n    requestAnimationFrame(animate);\n  }\n}\n// Start the animation\nrequestAnimationFrame(animate);\n```"

    "answer": "Both `substring` and `substr` are used to extract parts of a string, but there are subtle differences between the substring() and substr() methods in terms of **syntax** and **behavior**.\n\n     1. `substring(start, end)`\n         - **Parameters:**\n             - `start`: The index to start extracting (inclusive).\n             - `end`: The index to stop extracting (exclusive).\n         - **Behavior:**\n             - If `start > end`, it **swaps the arguments**.\n             - Negative values are treated as `0`.\n\n         ```javascript\n          let str = \"Hello World\";\n          console.log(str.substring(0, 5));   // \"Hello\"\n          console.log(str.substring(5, 0));   // \"Hello\" (swapped)\n          console.log(str.substring(-3, 4));  // \"Hell\" (negative = 0)\n         ```javascript\n     2. `substr(start, length)` _(Deprecated)_\n\n         - **Parameters:**\n           - `start`: The index to start extracting.\n           - `length`: The number of characters to extract.\n         - **Behavior:**\n           - If `start` is negative, it counts from the **end** of the string.\n           - If `length` is omitted, it extracts to the end of the string.\n\n         ```javascript\n         let str = \"Hello World\"; console.log(str.substr(0, 5)); // \"Hello\" \n         console.log(str.substr(-5, 3)); // \"Wor\" (starts from 'W')`\n         ```javascript\n         **Note:** substr() is considered a legacy feature in ECMAScript, so it is best to avoid using it if possible."

    "answer": "Nowadays JavaScript language is used in a wide variety of environments and each environment has its own object model. Due to this fact, there are different ways(syntax) to access the global object.\n\n     1. In web browser, the global object is accessible via `window`, `self`, or `frames`.\n     2. In Node environment, you have to use `global`.\n     3. In Web workers, the global object is available through `self`.\n\nThe `globalThis` property provides a standard way of accessing the global object without writing various code snippet to support multiple environments. For example, the global object retuned from multiple environments as shown below,\n\n```javascript\n//1. browser environment\nconsole.log(globalThis); // => Window {...}\n\n//2. node.js environment\nconsole.log(globalThis); // => Object [global] {...}\n\n//3. web worker environment\nconsole.log(globalThis); // => DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope {...}\n```"

    "title": "### What are shadowing and illegal shadowing?",
    "answer": "Both **shadowing** and **illegal shadowing** refer to how variable names can \"hide\" or override others within nested scopes.\n\n     **Shadowing** occurs when a variable declared within a certain scope (like a function or block) has the same name as a variable declared in an outer scope. The inner variable shadows the outer one — meaning, the inner variable takes precedence in its own scope.\n\n     Let's take an example where the inner `a` inside `func()` shadows the outer variable `a`.\n\n      ```javascript\n      let a = 10;\n\n      function func() {\n        let a = 20; // Shadows the outer 'a'\n        console.log(a); // 20\n      }\n\n      func();\n      console.log(a); // 10\n      ```javascript\n\n     **Illegal shadowing** in JavaScript refers to a syntax error that happens when you try to declare a block-scoped variable (`let` or `const`) with the same name as a variable declared using `var` in the same or an overlapping scope. \n\n     For example, if you declare both block-scoped variable and function scoped variable using the same name inside a function causes an illegal shadowing.\n\n      ```javascript\n      function test() {\n        var a = 10;\n        let a = 20; // SyntaxError: Identifier 'a' has already been declared\n      }\n      ```javascript\n    \n      As an another example, if you declare a variable with `let` or `const` in an outer scope, and then try to redeclare it with `var` inside a nested block, JavaScript throws an error — even though `var` is supposed to be function-scoped. Since the var appears in a block, it ends up trying to overwrite the `let` in the outer scope, which causes a conflict.\n\n      ```javascript\n      let a = 10;\n      {\n        var a = 20; // SyntaxError: Identifier 'a' has already been declared\n        console.log(a);\n      }\n      ```"

    "title": "### Why is it important to remove event listeners after use?",
    "answer": "In JavaScript, you need to be mindful of removing event listeners to avoid memory leaks — especially in long-lived apps like single-page applications (SPAs) or when working with frameworks/libraries. Eventhough JavaScript has automatic garbage collection, memory leaks can still happen if:\n\n  1. A DOM element is removed, but a listener still references it.\n  2. A callback (event listener) holds a reference to a large object or closure that can't be cleaned up.\n  3. Global objects like window, document etc retain listeners indefinitely unless manually removed.\n\n  So if you add any event listeners to DOM element, it is a good practice to remove it after its usage as shown below,\n\n  ```javascript\n     const button = document.getElementById(\"btn\");\n\n      function handleClick() {\n        console.log(\"Clicked!\");\n      }\n\n      button.addEventListener(\"click\", handleClick);\n\n      // Always remove when done\n      button.removeEventListener(\"click\", handleClick);\n  ```"

    "answer": "In JavaScript, `structuredClone()` is a built-in method used to create a **deep copy** of a value. It safely clones nested objects, arrays, Maps, Sets, Dates, TypedArrays, and even circular references — without sharing references to the original value. This prevents accidental mutations and makes it useful for state management and data processing.\n\n       For example, the below snippet demonstrates deep cloning of a nested object,\n\n        ```javascript\n           const originalObject = {\n             name: \"Deep Copy Test\",\n             nested: {\n            value: 10,\n            list: [1, 2, 3]\n  },\n};\n\n    const deepCopy = structuredClone(originalObject);\n\n    // Modify cloned value\n    deepCopy.nested.value = 99;\n    deepCopy.nested.list.push(4);\n    console.log(originalObject.nested.value); // 10\n    console.log(deepCopy.nested.value);       // 99\n    console.log(originalObject.nested.list);  // [1, 2, 3]\n    console.log(deepCopy.nested.list);        // [1, 2, 3, 4]"

    "title": "### What is the difference between const and Object.freeze",
    "answer": "The main difference is that `const` applies to **variables** (bindings), while `Object.freeze()` applies to **values** (objects).\n\n     1. **`const`**: Prevents the reassignment of a variable identifier. It ensures that the variable name always points to the same memory reference. However, if the variable holds an object or array, the *contents* of that object can still be modified.\n     2. **`Object.freeze()`**: Prevents the modification of an object's properties. It makes the object immutable (you cannot add, remove, or change properties), but it does not affect the variable assignment itself (unless the variable is also declared with `const`).\n\n     **Example:**\n\n     ```javascript\n       // Case 1: Using const (Reassignment prevented, Mutation allowed)\n       const person = { name: \"John\" };\n       person.name = \"Doe\"; // ✅ Allowed: The object is mutable\n       console.log(person.name); // \"Doe\"\n\n       // person = { name: \"Jane\" }; // ❌ Error: Assignment to constant variable\n\n       // Case 2: Using Object.freeze (Reassignment allowed, Mutation prevented)\n       let profile = { name: \"John\" };\n       Object.freeze(profile);\n\n       profile.name = \"Doe\"; // ❌ Ignored (or throws TypeError in strict mode)\n       console.log(profile.name); // \"John\"\n\n       profile = { name: \"Jane\" }; // ✅ Allowed: 'profile' is declared with 'let'\n       console.log(profile.name); // \"Jane\"\n       \n\n      \n\n\n<!-- QUESTIONS_END -->"

Since the value of both `!typeof myNumber` and `!typeof myString` is false, the if condition fails, and control goes to else block.\n\nTo make the ! operator operate on the equality expression, one needs to add parentheses:\n\n```javascript\nif (!(typeof myNumber === \"string\"))\n```javascript\n\nOr simply use the inequality operator:\n\n```javascript\nif (typeof myNumber !== \"string\")\n```javascript\n\n</p>\n\n</details>"

Next, Promise is native in ES6 and it will be moved to Job queue which has high priority than callback queue in the execution order. At last, since setTimeout is part of WebAPI the callback function moved to callback queue and executed. Hence, you will see number 2 printed first followed by 1.\n\n</details>"

This is because the try...catch statement works synchronously, and the function in the above code is executed asynchronously after a certain period of time. Hence, you will see runtime exception without catching the error. To resolve this issue, you have to put the try...catch block inside the function as below,\n\n```javascript\nsetTimeout(() => {\n  try {\n    console.log(\"try block\");\n    throw new Error(`An exception is thrown`);\n  } catch (err) {\n    console.log(\"Error: \", err);\n  }\n}, 1000);\n```javascript\n\nYou can use `.catch()` function in promises to avoid these issues with asynchronous code.\n\n</p>\n</details>"

It will treat each element as a string and sort it alphabetically. But if you try to sort an array of strings which has non-ASCII characters, you will receive a strange result. This is because characters with an accent have higher character codes.\n\nIn this case, the sort order of an array is ['Wann', 'Woche', 'wäre', 'wöchentlich'].\n\nIf you want to sort an array of string values which has non-ASCII characters in an ascending order, there are two possible options like **localeCompare** and **Intl.Collator** provided by ECMAScript Internationalization API.\n\n**localeCompare:**\n\n```javascript\nlet arr = [\"wöchentlich\", \"Woche\", \"wäre\", \"Wann\"];\nconsole.log(arr.sort((a, b) => a.localeCompare(b))); //['Wann', 'wäre', 'Woche', 'wöchentlich']\n```javascript\n\n**Intl.Collator:**\n\n```javascript\nlet arr = [\"wöchentlich\", \"Woche\", \"wäre\", \"Wann\"];\nconsole.log(arr.sort(Intl.Collator().compare)); //['Wann', 'wäre', 'Woche', 'wöchentlich']\n```javascript\n\n</p>\n</details>"

But if the function is not passed with any parameters, the `arguments` object doesn't include any argument eventhough the function has default function parameter. Hence, the function invocation with `undefined` has one argument and function call without any arguments has 0 arguments.\n\n</p>\n</details>"

    "answer": "```javascript\nconst numbers = [1, 2, 3];\n\n// Count how many numbers are odd\nlet xorAccumulator = numbers.reduce((sum, value) => {\n  return sum + (value % 2);\n}, 0);\n\n// IIFE applying XOR of each element shifted by its index\n(function(arr) {\n  for (let index = 0; index < arr.length; index++) {\n    xorAccumulator ^= (arr[index] << index);\n  }\n})(numbers);\n\nconsole.log(xorAccumulator);\n\n```javascript\n\n- 1: 5\n- 2: 7\n- 3: 11\n- 4: 1\n\n<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>\n<p>\n\n##### Answer: 3\n\nThis question is really showcasing how JavaScript mixes array reduction with low-level bitwise tricks. The code first uses .reduce() to turn the array into a single value by counting how many elements are odd, then an IIFE immediately kicks in and loops through the array again, shifting each number left by its index and XOR-ing it into the accumulator. The whole vibe is about understanding how reduction works for summarizing arrays and how bit shifting plus XOR can transform values in a way that feels mathematical rather than typical JS.\n</p>\n</details>\n\n\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe questions provided in this repository are the summary of frequently asked questions across numerous companies.

    "answer": "GC automatically reclaims memory by identifying reachable objects (referenced from GC Roots like stack variables or static fields). Unreachable objects are eligible for cleanup. Common algorithms:\r\n- **Mark-and-Sweep**: Marks live objects, sweeps dead ones.\r\n- **Generational**: Divides Heap into Young (Eden, Survivor) and Old Gen. Most objects die young (minor GC); survivors move to Old Gen (major GC).",
